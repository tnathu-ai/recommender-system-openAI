Jenna Jameson Heartbreaker Perfume for women 3.4 oz Eau De Parfum Spray,1.0,"I use a lot of perfume, I go through a new bottle every couple of weeks, and I never bought the same scent twice. I`m still looking for my favorite scent. This is not going to be it. I`m going to use it, but definitely not purchase again. Someone else may like it, it just does not lure my scents. Bottle is a very pretty, red glass, and it smells classier, than the name suggests.

I got this for evaluation, 50% off, in order that I might provide this review.

* I originally gave this 3 stars, but as I tried to use this further, I found the smell being just completely wrong. I asked three friends separately, what they think of it, and each one said, that this smells manly. And that was the exact word I was looking for. First two girls did not want to take this from me for free, the third one took it, but stated that really just a little at a time can be used. I downgraded this to 1 star, as it was in fact unusable and I wasted money on it. All four of us are in our early to late twenties and none of us liked this perfume. This is the only one 1 star review I ever wrote.",A2RYSCZOPEXOCQ,1.0,1.0,4.0
Norelco 6885XL Deluxe Quadra Action Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Men's Shaver,5.0,"First, a little background.  I've switched between Norelco electric razors and blades over the years, never quite satisfied with the shave I was getting.  Norelco has always said ""shaves as close as a blade or your money back"".  I've never found this to be true, but the razors were good enough that I didn't return them.  Most recently I used the Gilette Mach 3 razor which does a very good job.
Now here's why I give the 6885XL (6886XL is apparently the same model, sold at Costco and other warehouse stores) 5 stars:
- Closest shave yet.  This is the first electric razor I've used that shaves as close as a blade (including the Mach 3).  In fact, it shaves closer than a blade under my jaw and around my adam's apple.  I can't shave against the grain with a blade in those areas or my skin breaks out (and that's the only way to get the closest shave.)  With the 6885XL I don't have this problem and I get a really close shave.
- It's quiet.  Previous electric razors were so noisy I had to shave in another bathroom so I wouldn't wake my wife.  Not so with this one.
- Easy to clean.  Open the top and run hot water through it.  No more brushes (except for periodic maintenance).  An indicator will tell you when it's time to clean.
Other features:
- Charge remaining (in minutes) display.  This isn't particularly useful to me, but it seems reasonable accurate.
- It comes with a stand that holds the razor upright on the counter or basin.  Much neater than the razor just laying around or stuffed in a cabinet.
- Hard carrying case, for travel.
- Automatically adjusts to different voltages.
My wife about had a heart attack when I bought it.  However, it gives me the best shave ever (electric or blades).",A141OPVE376YFI,5.0,5.0,4.0

I do love the cleaning fluid despite what I think about the razor.  It works great - I've opened the razor after a cleaning cycle and the inside is spotless.  The smell is pleasant too.

Best of all, it lasts.  One cartridge lasts me 3 months.  I only clean my razor when the ""normal"" light is on, or every 2-3 shaves.  The cost to clean my razor works out to less than $20/year.

Braun 3000 Series InterFace/Interface Excel Replacement Pack,2.0,"The manufacturers of electric shavers appear to be taking pages out of the playbook used by makers of printers, which are often priced cheaper than the print cartridges themselves.  Once they've got you as a customer, they figure the red ink will soon be the customer's, not theirs.  Purchasing another screen (my 3rd or 4th in two years) for a shaver that cost me only 20% more than the flimsy foil itself strikes me as exhorbitant if not exploitive.  (The least Braun could do is make the foil available as a separate item rather than bundling it with the cutter assembly.)

No one ever told me that until I learned a few years ago. As you get older; your tongue forms little pockets on the top of your tongue. Dairy (milk, cheese, ice cream, etc) get in those holes of your tongue that causes bad breath too, so much sure you brush as close as you can back there. The stores used to sell tongue brushers but not sure if they still do; the tongue brushers don't have bristles so it makes it easier.

It smells like clean skin and perfumed soap.  The fact that it has a somewhat strong scent doesn't bother me because you can always use less.  Not bad for the low price of $3.17 at our local WalMart.  The only downside is that the cologne comes out fast, so you have to figure out a way to tip  out the cologne gently.  This is a no pretense type cologne that comes in a plastic bottle.  It might bother those with sensitive skin. I find that it warms the skin slightly on initial contact.  My advice - try it, but use it sparingly.",AXJ1QYBUL86ON,4.458333333333333,5.0,4.0

Not bad for the low price of $3.17 at our local WalMart.  The only downside is that the cologne comes out fast, so you have to figure out a way to tip  out the cologne gently.  This is a no pretense type cologne that comes in a plastic bottle.  It might bother those with sensitive skin. I find that it warms the skin slightly on initial contact.  My advice - try it, but use it sparingly.",AXJ1QYBUL86ON,4.458333333333333,5.0,4.0

"Aqua Velva After Shave, Classic Ice Blue, 7 Ounce",5.0,"HEY!! I am an Aqua Velva Man and absolutely love this stuff, been using it for over 50 years. This is a true after shave lotion classic. Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.

There slogan was "" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.

The NiCd batteries on these last 2 years max and fizz out. Mine died in 2005 and would not hold a charge. I was using this wired as a compromise as I could not afford to put down $$$ to buy another. Then one day my Panasonic phones battery died too. I found NiMh replacements for them, and it got me thinking. I home replaced the batteries on T-990 and the 6756X! using standard rechargeable AA batteries! . All it takes is a screwdriver, soldering iron and a pair of pliers. I put NiMh in the shaver and NiCd in the trimmer. What a difference! the stock batteries are sub par. The new batteries did the trick. Mine are still running after 6 years of nearly daily use. Why do I have 2 trimmers and shavers? I use one kit for travel and leave them with chargers at my site. Makes it easier not to pack TSA objectionable stuff while travelling. I think my NiCd's may be losing out though, I have to pull the charger out every other week and the power die down is pretty steep.

UPDATE (10/15/2013):
I have changed another set of batteries on these and they just keep going.

"Crest Whitestrips Dental Whitening System, 56 Strips",5.0,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth. However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions as specified inside the box.

1. Use the strips as directed on the box.  The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide; (in-office, or dentist-assisted dental whitening uses a 15-35% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white. Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2. Leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth, as this leads to sensitivity.

Disadvantages

1. Hydrogen Peroxide can ""burn"" your gums. If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn). Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to want to stop the treatment. It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal. Once they are healed, resume treatment with the White Strips. Try to not get the strip on your gums.

2. Your teeth may become senstiive during the week treatment time. Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off. You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc.  The peroxide causes a reversible inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.  If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching.

3. The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach. You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth. Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal. However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.

4. The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains. If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to begin bleaching with yoru dentist and then use the strips to continue the bleaching process.

Now comes the confusing part: Crest White Strips come in 4 different packages, each a bit different than the others.  The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  Here are the 4 packages:  1. Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  2. Crest White Strips Premium (10% hydrogen peroxide, 7-day treatment).  3. Crest White Strips Premium Plus (10% hydrogen peroxide, and has 12 additional strips).  4. Crest White Strips Renewal (9.5% hydrogen peroxide).  The cheapest method (at around 25 dollars, is the Crest Classic Whitestrips, but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment).  Premium and Premium Pro are both 10% peroxide formulations, work in 7-10 days, and the ""Premuim-Plus"" gives you 12 additional strips.  I am not sure why Crest recently came out with ""Renewal"", as it is a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10% concentration. Leave it to the manufacturer to confuse the consumer!

Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching.  This is much more expensive, but the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is much higher and this works better on stubbornly-stained teeth.

"Crest Whitestrips Dental Whitening System, 56 Strips",5.0,"I love this product. It is true what other say about the sensitivity. I would recommend using sensitivity toothpaste while you are using the strips, it helped for me. It made my teeth noticeably whiter. I would suggest you take a picture of yourself smiling before and after. I noticed the whiteness of my teeth when I saw a picture taken recently and I couldn't believe how nice they looked. I just had to dig up an old picture to compare and it was a big difference. After I have noticed this in the new picture, I love smiling for pictures now and showing my teeth. I was alway self conscious about it before.  That alone makes it worth the price.

I was very satisfied with my results. Make sure to read all the instructions before using.

It just became a part of my bedtime routine, not a bother at all. I just put one on while I was watching my evening TV programs and just kept an eye on the clock.

"Crest Whitestrips Dental Whitening System, 56 Strips",4.0,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest White Strips because they do work to whiten teeth.  Follow the directions in the box, and here are some further tips:

1.  (Optional step)  I recommend you first brush your teeth with water (don't use toothpaste) to remove the layer of plaque.  Your enamel has pores and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate. If you use a fluoridated toothpaste, the flouride may block the enamel pores.  (Crest's instructions indicate you do not need to brush. I talked to a Crest representative on this point, and she indicated that the hydrogen peroxide will penetrate plaque, therefore this step is optional.  The instructions indicate no brushing because they do not want fluoridated toothpaste on the teeth before whitening).

2.  Use the strips twice per day for maximum efectiveness.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called carbamide peroxide (a 6% form of hydrogen peroxide; in-office dental whitening uses a 15-30% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white.  Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2.  Leave the strips on for 30 minutes at a time.  After thirty minutes your saliva has probably diluted the peroxide to the extent that it is no longer effective.  You can reapply a new strip immediately if you chose, for the treatment requires one hour of treatment time per day to work.  It does not matter if you do this in one continuous 60-minute period or two 30-minute periods.  Do this for two weeks and your teeth should get whiter.

Disadvantages

1.  The chemical may ""burn"" your gums.  If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the peroxide oxidizing (or burning) your gums.  Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to stop the treatment.  It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal.  Once they feel normal again, resume treatment with the White Strips.

2.  Your teeth may become senstiive during the two-week treatment time.  Try to push yourself through the sensitivity if it is mild, but if it bothersome to cold water or air, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off.

3.  The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach.  You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth.

Norelco 7885XL Quadra Rechargeable Shaving System,4.0,"The 7825XL, 7845XL, 7865XL and 7885XL models are all basically the same razor, differing only in the way they display battery/charging  status (anywhere from 1 LED to a complete tiny LCD display).  The shaving peformance is fine for me -- not as close as a wet shave but that's a good thing for me personally because the closeness of wet shaves makes my face break out.  Every 3-7 years I buy a new Norelco and they get incrementally better each time.

I'm writing to warn about one feature.  Every shaver I'd had up to this one had a physical slider switch to turn it on and off.  This models has a push button.  This means you can't tell BY TOUCH whether it's on or off.  This is critical for me because I usually shave in the car (sitting in traffic) with the stereo blaring and I can't hear the shaver (especially since the newer models are pretty quiet).  I turn it on and off a lot as traffic conditions change.

Further, when the battery is low, my previous shavers would just run slower and slower until they came to a gradual stop.  This one slows slightly (imperceptably to me, really) and then just ""falls off the cliff"" and stops cold.  So you don't get any warning really that it's about to run out -- if I knew it was running down, then I'd shave a lot faster!

And this is where the tactile power switch feedback is important:  if the battery's totally drained, but I'm not done yet, I'll leave it off for a minute and then turn it on for 5-10 seconds of shaving before it dies again.  With the push-button power control this is really confusing because you're never really sure what's on and off.  It turns out the the power button is like a pulse that gets sent to an internal microcontroller (I'm guessing), so after it's been off for a while the power ""position"" doesn't matter, it's really off.  You just push to reboot the thing.

So, my 7825XL was robbed out of my car last night and I'm buying another one of these, so I guess that's an endorsement.  But I'm bumping up to the next higher model with better battery status indication ...",A2DG9F8YOXNY7Y,4.0,4.0,4.0

Norelco 7825XL Quadra Action Dry Razor,4.0,"The 7825XL, 7845XL, 7865XL and 7885XL models are all basically the same razor, differing only in the way they display battery/charging  status (anywhere from 1 LED to a complete tiny LCD display).  The shaving peformance is fine for me -- not as close as a wet shave but that's a good thing for me personally because the closeness of wet shaves makes my face break out.  Every 3-7 years I buy a new Norelco and they get incrementally better each time.

I'm writing to warn about one feature.  Every shaver I'd had up to this one had a physical slider switch to turn it on and off.  This models has a push button.  This means you can't tell BY TOUCH whether it's on or off.  This is critical for me because I usually shave in the car (sitting in traffic) with the stereo blaring and I can't hear the shaver (especially since the newer models are pretty quiet).  I turn it on and off a lot as traffic conditions change.

Further, when the battery is low, my previous shavers would just run slower and slower until they came to a gradual stop.  This one slows slightly (imperceptably to me, really) and then just ""falls off the cliff"" and stops cold.  So you don't get any warning really that it's about to run out -- if I knew it was running down, then I'd shave a lot faster!

And this is where the tactile power switch feedback is important:  if the battery's totally drained, but I'm not done yet, I'll leave it off for a minute and then turn it on for 5-10 seconds of shaving before it dies again.  With the push-button power control this is really confusing because you're never really sure what's on and off.  It turns out the the power button is like a pulse that gets sent to an internal microcontroller (I'm guessing), so after it's been off for a while the power ""position"" doesn't matter, it's really off.  You just push to reboot the thing.

So, my 7825XL was robbed out of my car last night and I'm buying another one of these, so I guess that's an endorsement.  But I'm bumping up to the next higher model with better battery status indication ...",A2DG9F8YOXNY7Y,4.0,4.0,4.0

Citre Shine Moisture Burst Shampoo - 16 fl oz,5.0,"Tried it once before I tossed it...and now it's the only one I use.

I have very dry skin and make up crepes under my eyes as a result.  Yes, I've tried many other creams (specifically, every one olay has ever come out with); I've also tried setting it with different powders after watching youtube videos.  For me, powder was the worst choice.

Since most beauty products cater to oily or combination skin,  I imagine that those of us with truly dry skin are more of a minority and so it's reasonable that this won't work for a lot of people.

But if you're like me and you could probably cover your face in olive oil and think, ""damn, now my skin looks nice"", this might be for you.  It is truly the only thing I've used that doesn't make my concealer or foundation crepe.

One reviewer compared it to Vaseline, which it is definitely not.  However, I can see where she was coming from.  It's thick and oily and just what my skin needs.  It also lasts longer than any dermatologist would recommend keeping it for.  I finally threw my first jar out after 6 months because eyeshadow fell in it, and it still looked almost as full as the first day I bought it.",A1EQRBC7NB1YAN,4.788732394366197,5.0,4.0

Citre Shine Moisture Burst Shampoo - 16 fl oz,5.0,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,AY8XPOPF0OVO5,4.788732394366197,5.0,4.0

I have thinner hair so this is perfect to adjust the heat just right. I highly recommend this product. It is compact and easy to store away. Also comes with a heat glove.

Citre Shine Moisture Burst Shampoo - 16 fl oz,4.0,"Once you add the five small feet at the bottom, the shampoo bowl stands approximately 38 inches tall before any higher adjustments are made.  The bowl is huge which is great.  It's 10 inches deep and 19 inches at it's widest point.  Assembly instructions could be improved but you can figure out how the pieces fit together.  The draining hose is made of very cheap plastic.  I wasn't able to bend the metal clamp at the right angle to keep the draining hose attached to the metal pole.  Fortunately I have a flexible extension hose from my Synergy Vac that fits perfectly and there are no leaks and no clamps necessary.  Three of the four metal cylinders that goes around the bolts that attaches the metal plate to the bowl wouldn't fit through the holes all the way.  Therefore the nut that attaches to the end of the bolt just barely had enough thread to grip onto to keep the bowl stable.

One design change that would improve these types of bowls is to place the drain hole at the back so that it can be used with a sink.  Otherwise water is best drained using a bathtub, shower or a bucket to catch the water.

I am happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this product especially at this price of under $30.",A1JPDW2ZPSQV8J,4.788732394366197,4.0,4.0

Citre Shine Moisture Burst Shampoo - 16 fl oz,4.0,"I passed this up several times as it never appealed to me in the store.
I smelled it a couple times but didn't care for it.
Then I received it in a swap with a friend and I finally gave it a try.
So glad I did I really like it.
It has a very unique fragrance something in it reminds me of Twilight woods, from B&BW, not exact but similar.
It has a floral tone and sweetness to it but not overwhelming.
It has a gelatinous texture, comes out kinda thick and gloopy like jelly in a large glob,
but quickly emulsifies with water and thins out.
Makes lots of suds and one big glop will be enough for the whole shower.
I do not notice any softening to the skin compared to regular soap and the scent does not stay on the skin.
Other then that it cleanses well and smells good.
I really like it a lot.",A2PHPWEDA1O7WL,4.788732394366197,4.0,4.0

  Also Calibra eye cream goes a long ways, You only use very little .  I give Calibra eye cream a  A+
  I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED CALIBRA EYE CREAM!!

I have been using it for about 1 week, and I have noticed my hair is soft and not wirey, from the bleach. I put it all over, minus my top roots and my hairline. This will only slightly weigh your hair down. My hair is past my hips, and I was not forced to cut it thanks to this product. I also, instead of rinsing straight away, let it sit overnight, washed it, and then repeated the process a few times.

Citre Shine Moisture Burst Shampoo - 16 fl oz,5.0,"I like cream shampoos. They harken back, which is sometimes nice, but also a container of cream shampoo tends to go further than a container of liquid shampoo. I landed on this and decided to try it.

What I wasn't expecting was that my hair would feel so wonderfully soft and full after the first wash! It lathered beautifully with just a dab of shampoo, rinsed easily and without being fly-away or unmanageable at all, my hair is really so soft. I'm kinda stunned. (As I always do, I rubbed actual coconut oil on my hands and then ran my hands through my hair before blow-drying. But I've always done that. My hair has never felt this good so it isn't because of the light coconut oil finish.)

This cream doesn't really smell anything like coconut oil, but more like a clean baby -- I don't know why.

To note -- at the time I ordered this I didn't realize it was coming from a company in the UK, where I'm not. They delivered in a timely manner, given that the package was sailing across a very large pond, but I'll look for this product from a US distributor the next time I order.

Although. It's worth every penny, so wherever I can get it ...",A1KDQXZHQIG5QG,4.788732394366197,5.0,4.0

Citre Shine Moisture Burst Shampoo - 16 fl oz,5.0,"I am a diehard bare minerals fan. Every single brush I own is by bare minerals EXCEPT for this one. I've used this brush nearly every day for at least 5 years now and the only reason I can tell its not brand-new is because the words ""Elizabeth Arden"" have worn off. I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

This brush is extremely high quality, worth every penny and if you take care of it, it will last you forever.",A2T146POE1RZTX,4.788732394366197,5.0,4.0

Citre Shine Moisture Burst Shampoo - 16 fl oz,5.0,"The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older. This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it).

I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress Conditioner&nbsp;for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible.

I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress&nbsp;conditioner and&nbsp;Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo&nbsp;(which had a scent I didn't like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  I replaced the shampoo with&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner.

I've tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me.

With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It's not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me.

Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I'm slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance.

The bottom line is using&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.

I'll update the review with observations about the ""strengthening"" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer.

First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner.

Update: Jan 9 2014
Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I'm now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.

What I'm using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it's like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.

Update: Feb 15 2015

I think I'm using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result.

Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.",A31N0XY2UTB25C,4.788732394366197,5.0,4.0

~PROS~
- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

Philips Norelco 6613X Reflex Plus Rechargeable Cordless Men's Shaving System,5.0,"Another ripped foil, so I finally relented and gave this Norelco a spin.  I'm not sure why I've gone out of my way to avoid this particular razor for the past 40 years--probably because of its dorky looks.  Face it, it's just not very ""masculine"" in its appearance--more ovarian than phallic, more like the grail than the lance.  But if you're willing to sacrifice form to function, this razor can't be beat.  It's the first one that caught every single hirsute strand on my neck in a single pass.

If you're beardless and unmustachioed, the Norelco is a bonafide no-brainer.  If you've got a number of hedges to trim around, the Norelco doesn't give you as clear a view or precise a cut as a more conventionally shaped Braun, Remington, or Panasonic.  On the other hand, the pop-out trimmer is the best I've ever seen, perfect for weeding out, pruning, shaping those less accessible areas.

As for spending fifteen to twenty bucks more for the next higher model (6843XL), the only difference I can see is color (blue instead of silver metallic) and a faster charging time (perhaps useful to those testosterone-rich individuals who require a shave every hour).",A6FIAB28IS79,5.0,5.0,4.0

Norelco Mens Electric Razor - 7845XL,4.0,"The 7825XL, 7845XL, 7865XL and 7885XL models are all basically the same razor, differing only in the way they display battery/charging  status (anywhere from 1 LED to a complete tiny LCD display).  The shaving peformance is fine for me -- not as close as a wet shave but that's a good thing for me personally because the closeness of wet shaves makes my face break out.  Every 3-7 years I buy a new Norelco and they get incrementally better each time.

I'm writing to warn about one feature.  Every shaver I'd had up to this one had a physical slider switch to turn it on and off.  This models has a push button.  This means you can't tell BY TOUCH whether it's on or off.  This is critical for me because I usually shave in the car (sitting in traffic) with the stereo blaring and I can't hear the shaver (especially since the newer models are pretty quiet).  I turn it on and off a lot as traffic conditions change.

Further, when the battery is low, my previous shavers would just run slower and slower until they came to a gradual stop.  This one slows slightly (imperceptably to me, really) and then just ""falls off the cliff"" and stops cold.  So you don't get any warning really that it's about to run out -- if I knew it was running down, then I'd shave a lot faster!

And this is where the tactile power switch feedback is important:  if the battery's totally drained, but I'm not done yet, I'll leave it off for a minute and then turn it on for 5-10 seconds of shaving before it dies again.  With the push-button power control this is really confusing because you're never really sure what's on and off.  It turns out the the power button is like a pulse that gets sent to an internal microcontroller (I'm guessing), so after it's been off for a while the power ""position"" doesn't matter, it's really off.  You just push to reboot the thing.

So, my 7825XL was robbed out of my car last night and I'm buying another one of these, so I guess that's an endorsement.  But I'm bumping up to the next higher model with better battery status indication ...",A2DG9F8YOXNY7Y,4.0,4.0,4.0

"Oral-B EssentialFloss Cavity Defense Dental Floss, 50 M, Pack of 24",4.0,"As any dental health professional will attest to, flossing one's teeth is just as important as brushing, and perhaps more so, for the bacteria that causes gum disease (and to a certain extent cavities) almost always starts between the teeth. Daily flossing breaks up the film of harmful bacteria and allows it to be removed.  Therefore, as a dentist, I am always stressing the importance of daily flosing to my patients.  My advice is this:

1.  Choose a floss that is comfortable to you and is the right thickness for your teeth.  Some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping the floss around the fingers, while others prefer thin flavored floss to waxed thick floss. There are so many options - choose the right one for you.

2.  Waxed floss is ""waxed"" to allow easier passage between the teeth.  Waxed floss is no more effective than unwaxed at removing the bacterial film build-up. The important thing is to floss!

3.  Floss once daily, preferably before brushing.  Flossing breaks up the film of bacteria between the teeth in areas a toothbrush cannot reach.  It is important to then brush the teeth and rinse between the teeth to remove the film of bacteria that the flossing has dislodged.  Without brushing or rinsing after flossing, the bacteria can reattach to the teeth.

4.  Try to tie in flossing with another habit, such as watching the 10 PM news.  I know it sounds strange, but incorporating flossing into another habit leads one into developing a new habit.  Some complain that they don't have time to floss; well, if flossing is tied into another habit, such as watching TV, both can easily be done concurrently.

5.  There are many gimmicks the manufacturers use to sell their particular brand of floss.  Some flavor the floss, some incorporate fluoride into the strands of floss, and some make their floss more slippery for folks with tight contacts.  Whatever the case, the most important point is to choose a floss variety you will use regularly.  It is the mechanical act of removing the bacterial flim that is the important part, not the flavoring or chemical additions to the floss.

6.  If you want to keep your teeth for a life-time, develop the flossing habit.  As one wise sage said: ""If you ignore your teeth, they will eventually go away"".

I recommend this product, but it must be used regularly to be effective.

I have short, layered hair and have been using&nbsp;Instant Heat Hot Brush, 1 1/4-Inch.  It does a good job, but some pieces of hair are just too short for its barrel. Any type hot brush is hard to find in a real store, so I started my initial search at Amazon instead.  1/2"" is the perfect size for short haircuts.  I prefer added body rather than outright curls, and this does that if the barrel is kept on my hair for about 6-8 seconds.

It only has two settings (low/high) compared to Conair's many.  That's okay--once I found the perfect Conair setting, I never moved it elsewhere anyway.  The high setting on Helen of Troy seems to deliver the same amount of heat as Conair's highest setting, so I'm happy.

Thank you, Amazon, for stocking a hard to find product and thank you, Helen of Troy, for making it.

Super Nail Polish Thinner 4 Ounce (118ml),5.0,"I purchased this nail polish thinner for my mother in law - her favorite nail polish was discontinued in the early 90s and I've luckily been able to find her several bottles off of eBay -- however, because its is old it can get a bit thick, so I got this nail polish thinner for her to help with this problem.  The only thing I wish that this nail polish thinner came with was an eye dropper or a pipette but for the price, that is okay.  I have also used this nail polish thinner to help with the thickening of some older polishes that have gotten a bit globby -- simply add a few drops to the bottle ... wait a couple seconds ... then roll the bottle in between your hands if you are going to use the polish shortly or shake the bottle if you do not plan on using it immediately or right away.  If a few drops does not work ... simply add a few more drops ... wait about 10 seconds ... then proceed to shake away until you hear the small ball bearings inside beat against the wall of the nail polish.  Be careful to only add a couple of drops at at time as you don't want to make the nail polish you are trying to thin out too watery or useless.  The nail polish thinner does have a strong odor, but then again it is a chemical, just be sure to use it in a well ventilated area and be sure to put the cap back on immediately.  I would highly recommend that you do not use this nail polish thinner on a wood table or anything with a lacquer or finish on it - it will eat away at it immediately.  Use this over a sink or put several towels that you do not care about down - just be very careful! Just like you would be very careful with acetone nail polish - use the same caution with the thinner.

This thinner will help you to save money and keep your old polish just like new! It really helped to make old polish or polish that I hadn't completely tightened the lid on smooth and creamy again (almost like new but nothing is exactly like new). After using this thinner in one of my favorite polishes I was able to put up to three semi-thin coats of nail polish on my nails and they have looked really great for nearly a week and it has not begun to chip. The thinner came in a heavy glass bottle and there is plenty to last quite a long time.  Overall I am very pleased with this thinner - I highly recommend it and once I run out, I will definitely purchase it again.

Super Nail Polish Thinner 4 Ounce (118ml),5.0,"I purchased this nail polish thinner for my mother in law - her favorite nail polish was discontinued in the early 90s and I've luckily been able to find her several bottles off of eBay -- however, because its is old it can get a bit thick, so I got this nail polish thinner for her to help with this problem.  The only thing I wish that this nail polish thinner came with was an eye dropper or a pipette but for the price, that is okay.  I have also used this nail polish thinner to help with the thickening of some older polishes that have gotten a bit globby -- simply add a few drops to the bottle ... wait a couple seconds ... then roll the bottle in between your hands if you are going to use the polish shortly or shake the bottle if you do not plan on using it immediately or right away.  If a few drops does not work ... simply add a few more drops ... wait about 10 seconds ... then proceed to shake away until you hear the small ball bearings inside beat against the wall of the nail polish.  Be careful to only add a couple of drops at at time as you don't want to make the nail polish you are trying to thin out too watery or useless.  The nail polish thinner does have a strong odor, but then again it is a chemical, just be sure to use it in a well ventilated area and be sure to put the cap back on immediately.  I would highly recommend that you do not use this nail polish thinner on a wood table or anything with a lacquer or finish on it - it will eat away at it immediately.  Use this over a sink or put several towels that you do not care about down - just be very careful!

"Crest Premium White Strips, 28 Count",5.0,"When I first met my wife, it wasn't too long before she suggested that I might have whiter, bright teeth and a better smile by using ""Crest Whitestrips."" Whiter teeth? Moi? I brushed my teeth twice every day and had them regularly cleaned twice a year. Yet, close inspection indicated they were indeed a bit yellow and stained, and I always assumed it was just my age. Or maybe it was the coffee or red wine. So, if a new girlfriend suggests Whitestrips, then Whitestrips it is. Several days later we went to a pharmacy and purchased the ""Crest Whitestrips Premium"" packet.

I followed the instructions as closely as possible. It was a bit difficult getting started with getting the strips on and then holding them in place for the suggested time. I finally worked out a routine wherein I would fit them in prior to driving to her place. When I'd get there, I'd discard them. When I'd head back for home (about a 20-minute trip), I'd put a new pair in and take them out upon arrival. I'd make the round trip about every couple days so it took a little longer for the total whitening treatment but the arrangement worked fine and didn't waste any time. Plus it was easy to remember.

We began noticing the whitening after about three or four days. It was very subtle and gradual at first, but by the end of the packet, my teeth were noticeably whiter and brighter. It was a good improvement. The whitening agent was applied, of course, only to the front teeth, but those are the most noticeable and it works out fairly well for my smile. I'd say if you want whiter, brighter teeth this is a reasonably good product and not very expensive. It's not perfect, and I may try a few of the other whitening methods. It's also not permanent and I've now got a third kit for another go at whitening. Using the procedure about every year to 1.5 years seems to work best for me.

"Crest Premium White Strips, 28 Count",4.0,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth. However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions exactly as specified inside the box.

1. First brush your teeth with a wet toothbrush to remove the layer of plaque (toothpaste is unnecessary). Rinse your teeth well with water.  Tooth enamel has pores, and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate.

2. Use the strips as directed on the box.  The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide; (in-office, or dentist-assisted dental whitening uses a 15-35% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white. Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2. Leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth, as this leads to sensitivity.

Disadvantages

1. Hydrogen Peroxide can ""burn"" your gums. If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn). Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to want to stop the treatment. It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal. Once they are healed, resume treatment with the White Strips. Try to not get the strip on your gums.

2. Your teeth may become senstiive during the week treatment time. Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off. You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc.  The peroxide causes an inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.  If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching.

3. The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach. You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth. Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal. However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.

4. The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains. If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.

Now comes the confusing part: Crest White Strips come in 4 different packages, each a bit different than the others.  The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  Here are the 4 packages:  1. Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  2. Crest White Strips Premium (10% hydrogen peroxide, 7-day treatment).  3. Crest White Strips Premium Plus (10% hydrogen peroxide, and has 12 additional strips).  4. Crest White Strips Renewal (9.5% hydrogen peroxide).  The cheapest method (at around 25 dollars, is the Crest Classic Whitestrips, but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment).  Premium and Premium Pro are both 10% peroxide formulations, work in 7-10 days, and the ""Premuim-Plus"" gives you 12 additional strips.  I am not sure why Crest recently came out with ""Renewal"", as it is a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10% concentration. Leave it to the manufacturer to confuse the consumer!

Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.  White Strips don't work as fast as a dentist-made custom tray bleaching, (or in-office bleaching) but over time, you will get a result that will be close to that of a dentist, and you will save money too.

I recommend starting with with either the Classic or the Premium-Pro. The Classic works in 2 weeks and is about $1.80 a day.  The Premium Pro works in 10 days and is about $2 dollars a day.  The Premium and Premium Pro are likely to give you more sensitivity than the Classic.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching using a custom-tray system or in-office bleaching.  This is much more expensive, but the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is much higher and this tends to work better on stubbornly-stained teeth.

"Crest Premium White Strips, 28 Count",5.0,"The Crest Whitestrips do reveal good results, but if you drink tea or coffee, you are fighting an uphill battle. Instead of whitening your teeth all at once (although that is a good option at the start) you may want to keep these around for occasional touch ups, important occassions and feel good moods.

The strips for upper and lower teeth are easy to use and don't seem to promote as much tooth sensitivity as other whitening procedures (like with the annoying gel). In fact, it almost seems to make your gums more healthy than before.

Probably the most pleasant whitening experience on the market with fairly good results. Why the box has a mirror in it, we will never know unless it is useful to see the results of the whitening. It would be difficult to hold the box and put the strips on your teeth.

I'd recommend trying these and then keeping a box handy for touch up use. Probably will whiten your teeth one or two shades on the first use.

"Crest Premium White Strips, 28 Count",4.0,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth. However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions exactly as specified inside the box.

1. First brush your teeth with a wet toothbrush to remove the layer of plaque (toothpaste is unnecessary). Rinse your teeth well with water.  Tooth enamel has pores, and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate.

2. Use the strips as directed on the box.  The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide; (in-office, or dentist-assisted dental whitening uses a 15-35% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white. Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2. Leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth, as this leads to sensitivity.

Disadvantages

1. Hydrogen Peroxide can ""burn"" your gums. If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn). Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to want to stop the treatment. It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal. Once they are healed, resume treatment with the White Strips. Try to not get the strip on your gums.

2. Your teeth may become senstiive during the week treatment time. Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off. You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc.  The peroxide causes an inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.  If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching.

3. The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach. You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth. Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal. However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.

4. The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains. If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.

Now comes the confusing part: Crest White Strips come in 4 different packages, each a bit different than the others.  The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  Here are the 4 packages:  1. Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  2. Crest White Strips Premium (10% hydrogen peroxide, 7-day treatment).  3. Crest White Strips Premium Plus (10% hydrogen peroxide, and has 12 additional strips).  4. Crest White Strips Renewal (9.5% hydrogen peroxide).  The cheapest method (at around 25 dollars, is the Crest Classic Whitestrips, but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment).  Premium and Premium Pro are both 10% peroxide formulations, work in 7-10 days, and the ""Premuim-Plus"" gives you 12 additional strips.  I am not sure why Crest recently came out with ""Renewal"", as it is a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10% concentration. Leave it to the manufacturer to confuse the consumer!

Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.  White Strips don't work as fast as a dentist-made custom tray bleaching, (or in-office bleaching) but over time, you will get a result that will be close to that of a dentist, and you will save money too.

I recommend starting with with either the Classic or the Premium-Pro. The Classic works in 2 weeks and is about $1.80 a day.  The Premium Pro works in 10 days and is about $2 dollars a day.  The Premium and Premium Pro are likely to give you more sensitivity than the Classic.  If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching using a custom-tray system or in-office bleaching.  This is much more expensive, but eh concentration of hydrogen peroide is much higher and this works better on stubbornly-stained teeth.

Permanent Color-8N/Natural Light Blonde Tints of Nature 4.4 oz Liquid,5.0,"I decided to go gray three years ago, and really loved my silver-white hair.  However, I am 58 and looking for another job and after going on several interviews, I  realized that age discrimination is a reality that I need to deal with.  First, I  started having a colorist weave in some lowlights.  Brown lowlights looked terrible with the white hair, and when she tried a darker color the next time, the lowlights came out ash gray.  It's very hard to find a colorist who knows how to do gray hair blending, by the way.  So, with more than $200 down the drain on lowlight attempts,  I decided to bite the bullet and just color it medium brown (my natural color before I went gray) myself.  After researching several organic products and reading online reviews, I decided on Tints of Nature.  I first bought the 4N Medium Brown because the Tints of Nature website says the product will lift your color one shade lighter.  But then I read more online reviews and found a u-tube clip that a woman shared where she colored her medium brown hair with T of N's medium blond color, as she had heard the color comes out darker than is expected. The result was medium brown.  So I went back to the store and bought 6N and 6TF--caramel/dark toffee blond to cancel out the ash lowlights.  I didn't have time to do the recommended gray hair treatment (my hair was fairly healthy from not dying it for 3 years) or to do a strand or patch test.  I used the shampoo and crme rinse that comes in the box, then towel dried my hair as directed.  I mixed half of both colors into the developer (and am saving the other halves and other developer) and coated my damp hair with the mixture, then ran a comb through to ensure every strand was coated and that the color was evenly distributed.  I was really afraid that the color wouldn't cover my white hair or that it would be too light, and that it wouldn't color over the ashy lowlights.  So  I waited the recommended 40 minutes before I washed it out.  To my relief, the color came out a beautiful, rich medium brown with slightly golden/reddish highlights (the 6TF)--and it fully covered my white hair.  While I hate coloring my hair and especially hate doing touch-ups, such a mess, this is a good product.  I experienced no burning or itching from the dye, nor was the smell terribly offensive, and best part, no animals are tested.

I feel like I want to make up a new word that embodies the perfection of them. I haven't figured out yet how they do the prints it sort of reminds me of a batik style of dying but, most likely is just a print. The zipper also works great and all the seams are very well done..

They use it every day and wash their own hands with Dawn and it doesn't dry them out.

Dawn is made by procter and gamble, and they have donated over 500 thousand dollars to wildlife groups from the sales of Dawn.

The ultra works great for getting dried egg off of my dishes, and put a little in a pot to soak come back and rinse it out with a light brushing.

There are greener cleaners out there as veterinarian and head of the International Bird Rescue Research Center points out, but none of the has dawns magic she says. Dawn has petroleum in it as an ingredient. Probably why it moisturizes / doesn't dry out your hands.

Truefitt &amp; Hill Trafalgar After Shave Splash 100ml/3.38oz,5.0,"I've used&nbsp;Dawn Original&nbsp;for years and liked it very much. I picked up&nbsp;Dawn Platinum&nbsp;late in 2013 and after 3 months I've used less than Dawn Original and my dishes, silverware, glasses, mugs pots and pans all very clean. BUT my hands are getting dried out when I use it.

I don't use an automatic dishwasher, just the two manual ones at the end of my arms!

During the winter I like to use my&nbsp;Slow Cooker. Anyone who is a slow cooking fan knows it can be a challenge to clean the pot or crock used. Using Dawn Ultra for Soaking loosens stubborn food considerably in a couple of hours. I think it is not quite as effective as Dawn Platinum but still an effective soak.

The scent of Dawn Ultra Original Scent is not unpleasant and is mild. Platinum's scent is more mild and for me less is better.

Both Dawn Ultra and Platinum require less product than Original in my experience. Less frequent purchases save shopping time and money. Both a plus.

The biggest differences for me between Dawn Ultra and Platinum are Platinum drying out my hands  and Platinum may be better for soaking.  In the summer when I'm not soaking as much I think Dawn Ultra is the best choice. Less drying out for the hands. In winter it's much closer. Ultra is a bit better as a soak.

I think Dawn Platinum and Ultra are very close in terms of cleaning. Both are an improvement over Dawn's Original formula dish washing liquid and worth a try.

Hope this helps someone.",A31N0XY2UTB25C,4.75,5.0,4.0

"NARS Blush, Taj Mahal",5.0,"The color Orgasm, is a peachy pink with gold flecks.  On, it looks just like a natural flush.  I use it when I wear brown, peach or khaki clothing.  The gold flecks are not glittery at all and they add just a touch of sheen.  I also have the Nars Multiple in Orgasm, which I use first, then I go over it with the Orgasm powder formula, which together, provide all day wear.  The Super Orgasm is a coral flecked with gold, more gold than the Orgasm but still subtle.  Coral is a universally flattering shade and is especially pretty with summer colors.  Even in the winter, it keeps me from looking sallow.  Although I'm light, but not fair, with hazel eyes and dark blond hair, Super Orgasm would be equally pretty on medium or olive skin or African American coloring.  The formula lasts all day without changing color or fading, so you won't need to touch it up.  I love Nars makeup, except the foundation, and I use the creme blush in Cactus Flower under the Super Orgasm powder blush to give it extra staying power.  My skin is oily but if you chose to use just the powder blush, it would be fine for normal or dry skin types.  I've had these Nars blushes for several years and have yet to put a dent in them. It takes only a swipe or two with a brush to get the proper amount of product.

They last all day and all night.  They do not dry your skin, irritate, or fade.  I have them all.  I saw some negative reviews on the blush simply because it was not the right color choice.  You have to know what colors look good on you.  Not every color is for everyone :)  I happen to have very fair skin (I am Mont Blanc in NARS Sheer glow foundation) and this is actually my favorite blush color of all.  Beautiful...makes your skin glow, but not look too sparkly or highlighted.  I add a little on my eyes and cheeks and I am good to go. I am in love with NARS blushes!!!  You must try.

1. Mata hari
Matte mauve pink. Gorgeous for everyday adds a natural looking flush to the cheeks. It is lighter than MAC slave to love blush which was one of my old favorites before I tried NARS!
2. Taos
Described as a dusty rose, but has coral tones on my skin tone. Has some shimmer but not very noticeable once applied to the skin. This one is very long lasting. Nice for brightening up your day...and your complexion!
3. Taj mahal
Looks very gold in the pan but adds such a pretty warmth to the cheeks that's a little shimmery and lit from within. There are many ravs about this blush on beauty blogs and YouTube and its true!
4. Desire
A scary bright bright bright pink in the pan but also very good quality giving cheeks the natural flush you crave for everyday. I've also seen this one on deeper skin tones and it still looks natural and flattering
5. Love joy
I was wondering if this would show up or just look like shimmer on my skin. After application it was a brownish berry color with slight shimmer and the blush I choose when I'm doing a strong smoky or colorful eye look. Looks very natural on my skin tone. Can't really be used to contour because it has the berry tone. The nars site describes this of a bronzed rose but on skin tones similar to mine would be berry toned.
6. Exhibit A
I've seen this on light medium and deep skin tones and it is widely flattering! Turns more red than orange on my skin but can look more orange on you depending on your undertones. Every woman should have this one in their arsenal. Some people believe this gives the most natural looking flush of all. It also photographs really well and looks good on video! Lol :)

Start your collection with any one of these if you're skin tone is similar to mine. NARS blush is one of the best blush brands out there I encourage you to try at least one even thought they have a higher price point. They are very pigmented and last a long time too!

Edit
I have grown my collection!
Torrid : a peachy shimmer....you would not believe how beautiful this is on my cheek...that lit from within look!

Sin: glowy mauvy cheeks very beautiful. Also gorgeous on lighter skin tones to my own

Dolce vita: with a very light hand i can pull this one off. A little harder to blend than the others

If you already have some kind of 'orange' vibe going on, you probably want to steer away from this one. I am pasty pale with auburn/copper red hair, this just made me look like the Wendy's sign. It was not good with my base coloring.

I gave it 3 because no matter that the color looks bad on me, the product quality is still there. This would look incredible on someone with pigment in their skin, I'm almost envious of anyone who could wear this, just because it's so pretty in the pan.

I am very pale, and have auburn/reddish hair. This color SHOULD in theory look pretty spiffy on me, but I can't get past the fact that it looks like a GLITTERBOMB exploded on my face. What the ..>?!?!?!?!? And easy to overdo? Yes indeed! This blush is very very silky and soft; use a light hand. You can always add more but woe be to anyone who overapplies it. You'll look like a feverish clown!

For us (ahem) older ladies, try the Deep Throat. Pretty much the same color, without the glitty garbage all over every pore on your face!

UPDATE: I have the Orgasm/Laguna duo (reviews and photos and comparisons to other products coming soon) and it has been sitting ever since my horrifying discovery out in daylight, that there were glitter bits on my face from using the Orgasm blush. I have since discovered---your brush makes a LOT of difference. I switched to a very fluffy Real Techniques brush instead of my usual blush brush; it deposited gentle color and the glitter was very iffy. (As in, you couldn't really see obvious glitter but if you were verycloselikethis you could see tiny bits) I have revised my review a little bit. Still giving the advice that it's easy to overapply and, this color is sure not for everyone, but I don't want to shoot it with a silver bullet any more. If your skin has any tendency towards redness at all, I implore you to do a test run with this before you count on it looking good for any important (or public) event! I practically have to get microscopic amounts of this on the brush or it's too much for me, and does nothing positive to enhance my complexion. Pretend it's poisonous if you put on more than three nanospecks of it, that will help :-)",ARYSDAZNRXN6G,4.552631578947368,2.5,4.0

For us (ahem) older ladies, try the Deep Throat. Pretty much the same color, without the glitty garbage all over every pore on your face!

UPDATE: I have the Orgasm/Laguna duo (reviews and photos and comparisons to other products coming soon) and it has been sitting ever since my horrifying discovery out in daylight, that there were glitter bits on my face from using the Orgasm blush. I have since discovered---your brush makes a LOT of difference. I switched to a very fluffy Real Techniques brush instead of my usual blush brush; it deposited gentle color and the glitter was very iffy. (As in, you couldn't really see obvious glitter but if you were verycloselikethis you could see tiny bits) I have revised my review a little bit. Still giving the advice that it's easy to overapply and, this color is sure not for everyone, but I don't want to shoot it with a silver bullet any more. If your skin has any tendency towards redness at all, I implore you to do a test run with this before you count on it looking good for any important (or public) event! I practically have to get microscopic amounts of this on the brush or it's too much for me, and does nothing positive to enhance my complexion. Pretend it's poisonous if you put on more than three nanospecks of it, that will help :-)",ARYSDAZNRXN6G,4.552631578947368,2.5,4.0

"NARS Blush, Taj Mahal",5.0,"I really love NARS blushes and I always am searching for the perfect color. I currently own: Luster, Albatross, Torrid, Orgasm and Taj Mahal blushes. I gave torrid a try because I am an light olive skin complexion (NC20-NC30) and I thought it would look great on me. With the Orgasm blush I have to layer it on with a pretty heavy hand and I wanted something I could use less of, but same color wise.
 I will def say I was a bit disappointed with the color, but maybe that was just my expectations. I was hoping that it would be a lot more pigmented that the NARS Orgasm, but in the identical color range. Sadly, It isn't.
The orgasm blush is a peachy pink with golden sheen. Almost like a blush and highlight in one. The Torrid blush is burnt reddened pink with golden micro glitter. Not overly glitter, but very different that the golden sheen that Orgasm gives you. These differences might be good for you if you were looking for blushes that were in a league of there own, but I am not. I find that this blush typically lasts about 6 good hours on me. Just for reference I have combo skin, meaning I have a oily T-zone and regular skin type on my cheeks. Not dry and not oily.

If you are looking for a blush that would compliment both lighter skintones and darker skintones, get Torrid. Don't be afraid of the color or how pigmented it is. Get a stippling brush or a synthetic brush and grab a bit of color and blend. You can always go back and get more color, but if you add too much at one time, you will get the clown cheek effect. I have to add that this blushes lasts a very long time. I have had it for about 2 years now and still have yet to hit pan.

Update:I would like to also add that since buying this, it has gone up by a dollar.

UPDATE #2: I still own this product and I have to say I love it because its different than my other blushes. I originally was hoping it was similar to another blush I own, but I'm now glad it's not.",A121Z2MIFURY0O,4.552631578947368,5.0,4.0

"NARS Blush, Taj Mahal",5.0,"Some of the colors look scary in the compact because they are so highly pigmented. Exhibit A, for example, is a bright clownish looking orange-red that surely has scared off many a gal. But for those who know how to use a blush brush properly (ie, high quality bristles, good construction, a judicious amount of pressure, good blending), these babies pay off. And I mean pay off not just in beautiful color, but in how long they last, because this quality and pigmentation means you don't need to use a lot. One of these can last you a long, long time, even with daily use.

I have Exhibit A, Torrid, Taos, Crazed, Luster, and Mata Hari, which covers a range of warm and cool tones. Exhibit A is my fave go to red blush. Using just a touch of my duo-fibre MAC brush on it (ie MAC 187 brush), this deposits a beautiful, face-brightening blush to the cheeks. Too much and you look like Bozo, so this does require restraint.

Mata Hari is a lovely, feminine, cool pink-rose tone that I, who have olive skin, can wear and look like I was out walking briskly. Those two are my fave ones from NARS as they are matte. The others have some shimmer and require even more care in application and go well with a shiny gloss on the lips.

Luster is more like a highlighting color for me (it's a goldeny-lustrous color on me). It's pretty much the color of my skin with shimmer, so I can put it on without a color payoff, but it gives a nice glow that I like for days when I look ""tired"". A perking up thing. Also nice for adding glow when going out at night/to a party. On a lighter person, it's probably a nice warmth on the cheeks, sort of like a subtle bronzer. Could probably highlight eyes, all over, too. It's versatile.

Crazed is a deep raspberry pink with shimmer (ie, a cooler color that has glowiness). Taos is like a somewhat warm deep rosed-up red. It's a color that will definitely suit darker tones, but can be used by fairer women with much restraint. Torrid is a gorgeous deep peachy sort of tone with shimmer. I'm wearing it today with Manhunt by NARS (lipstick) overlaid with Red Devil coral-red gloss by MAC. Torrid is not as deeply-intense as Crazed or Taos, but it's not a shy color either. Will give a nice payoff.

I'm med-dark olive toned (NC44 in MAC) and all those look fine on me. I'm ordering Gilda to add to the peachy colors in my blush collection (which right now includes two MAC peachy tones and one by Physician's Formula). With summer coming in, I'm looking for peachier/warmer tones.

These are expensive-ish, but these are top-notch, and it's no wonder makeup artists and celebrities love NARS blushes. (Note: I don't own the much-touted, much-beloved, nearly legendary Orgasm, though, which is more suited to ligther-than-me gals, but it really is pretty in the pan. I have heard good things about Super Orgasm colorwise, if you don't mind having chunks of glitter fall off your brush.)

UPDATE: I got my Gilda blush and it's lovely. A soft-textured, nicely-pigmented matte peach that will look fabulous with peachy-coral and more orangey glosses for Spring and summer, or even with nude glosses.",A1WX42M589VAMQ,4.552631578947368,5.0,4.0

DERMA E Anti-Wrinkle Renewal Cream with Vitamin A Retinyl Palmitate 4oz,4.0,"Derma E is a company, which specializes in a large array of skin care and beauty oriented products. The company focuses in effective ingredients and skips on the packaging, so the consumer pays more towards what is inside the bottle, versus what is outside of it! Derma E, is not limited to just ant-aging regimens and if you checkout their website. they have everything from sun care, hair and scalp, to wipes, mask, serums and anything to satisfy your skin care needs.  The company has a long history in making products with natural ingredients, which have always been Vegan friendly and Cruelty-Free.

I was sent a jar of their Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin A Retinyl Palmitate Crme, which is part of the Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin A Essentials line. Focused on aging skin and helping with cell rejuvenation via Retinyl.

Ingredients (as listed on the jar):
Purified Water (Aqua), Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, Glycerin, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate SE, Cetyl Alcohol, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Sesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed Oil, Helianthus Annus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Panthenol (Provitamin B5), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Allantoin, Cedrus Atlantica (Cedarwood) Essential Oil, Phenylethyl Alcohol, Vanillin, Carbomer, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.

Verdict:
I tested out the product for 10 days to get an idea of how well it satisfied my skincare needs. The creme is thicker in texture than most products of like kind, however I noticed that if I use a small dab, not only does it cover the treated area well but its more than enough for treatment. I apply Retinyl only to the areas that I feel are my problem areas and because Retinyl palmitate tends to have an oily texture, I know to go light with application. Being a past Retinol user, my skin has also acclimated to any adverse effects and I no longer experience any sensitivity or redness from such ingredient.  I applied to where I suffer from fine lines, so I focused in the under eye area and forehead. The creme is smooth and does aid with softening the skin, which not only hydrates but protects well. With the mixed weather we have been experiencing from Autumn, the warmer days into cold nights tend to stress my skin out. The Dema E creme made sure to always keep that layer of protection present. Retinyl palmitate, is effective in the turn over process, meaning skin cells shed quicker and its almost speeding up the clock to be able to rejuvenate quicker and produce a newer layer of skin that appears more flawless. The Retinyl palmitate formula from Derma E is filled with antioxidants and a selection of oils to insure the user gets the best chance at recovering a more useful appearance. I did feel the creme was thicker of course than my serums but after 2 days of getting use to the amount I needed to accomplish full coverage, it then got easier estimating how much to get out so it would not affect my make-up. I was satisfied with the product because the claims made are true and this jar is not pricey, plus gives the user real results! The creme from Derma E has 10,000 I.Us, so its on par with the recommended amount for a user to experience results. The only con I have is the product coming in jar form, as I prefer tubes that keep fingers/nails away from the product but I do have a plastic spatula I use just for these type of containers. Other than that, I was happy using and testing a product that works and I know I can easily fit into my budget because its affordable.

I received the above product(s) free of charge from Derma E.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.",A6P370Q9YB27F,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.0

NARS Powder Blush Cheek Color,5.0,"These are so exquisitely milled and pigmented that it's not irritating to my sensitive skin. I also only need a very little to make my cheeks pop, so it lasts and lasts.

ORGASM may be the holy grail of blusher for many fairer women, but I'm an NC44 Latina (med-dark olive tone) and that color would not make a showing on me. I did find that two colors have become my staple blushes.

For warm-tone days, I use EXHIBIT A, a matte blush that is scary in the pan (so brightly orange-red) that most women would think ""Bozo the Clown"". No, it works beautifully on my tone, brightening me (we olive toned women can look sallow and blah without a color pop). Fabulous.

For cool days (and by cool I'm talking my color choices for clothes and lipstick, not weather), I like  MATA HARI. It's a matte cool pink tone that is deep enough to show on my cheeks and give me a look that says ""Healthful"" or ""just went for a quick jog and has blood circulating well"". Nice.

I plan to try CRAZED and TAOS, which seem to be shimmery cousins to my two faves (ie, one is warmer, one is cooler).

I think the thing is to head to a store like Sephora and just try the shades. With the array of beautiful colors, you will find a couple or more colors that make you feel and look great.

NOTE: You really need a quality brush to get just enough pigment and deposit not too much pigment. That's my recommendation. These blushes do not come with little cheapo rough brushes like so many do. No, get a good blush brush--a MAC one, or a Sephora, etc. I use the MAC duo-fiber brush, smaller one, and it works very well with these strong shades.

Yes, pricey. But I've gone through so many disappointing blushes in drugstore brands and even from some name brands, that it's a relief to find blushers that WORK for me and make me happy and don't make me itch!

Hurrah for NARS.

I used both the eye serum and face moiture cream and it goes on so easy, very light and very moisturizing.  I noticed that my face is no longer dry, not oily, just perfect to where is should be.  Skin does get tight as advertised, but not in a way where your face is burning or dry.  Just taught.

Braun 8000 Activator Combi-Pack Foil and Cutterblock Replacement Parts for Braun's Activator Razor Models 8595 and 8585,5.0,"I did some corporate research on Proctor & Gamble and learned what actually happened: P&G bought into Gillette, who owns Braun. Global Gillette was making high-quality, 100% German sourced blades for both shaver markets(wet/electric). To subsidize the buyout - P&G immediately dissolved Global Gillette and sent ALL blade and shaver component production to China(Braun Electric, Shanghai Co. Ltd). Braun released one last 100% German-made shaver in mid-2006 - The 360 Complete(8975/8985/8995). Gillette Germany supplied all the OEM 360 Complete blades, which was re-designed as the 51S, simply because the fully-compatible Activator 8000FC sold like hotcakes and Braun could not replenish the product fast enough. Despite the superior performance of the 8000FC blade/cutter....it was saddled with rapid wear, well before Braun's 18-month replacement cycle.

The Gillette-designed 51S that shipped with the 360 Complete shavers was actually an improvement. The wider blade design had an ""axe-type"" blade cross-section, as opposed to the foil-destroying, ""dagger-type"" cross-section of the 7000-8000FC. The 51S Gillette designed specified a half circular billet of surgical stainless with precision-machined edges, which were sharp as glass. Premature wear was a non-issue, with the German 51S. Many original 360 Complete users were reporting blade replacement intervals from 18 months....up to 5 years! Gillette made 51S replacements up to 2007....only to be replaced with a far more inferior China-made, but German-assembled foil and cutter. P&G's bait-and-switch was simple: spoil existing users with excellent NOS Gillette blades and then STING them with cheap Chinese replacements...hence, all your bad reviews once NOS 8000FC depleted sometime after 2009.

As for shavers - Braun was fully tooled-up and ready in China, when they released the Braun Series 3/5/7/9 shavers, in late 2008. All ""Series X"" shavers are designed in Germany, parts ALL made in China, then shipped BACK to Germany for final assembly and packaging.....legally qualifying their product as, ""Made in Germany."" P&G clearly knew well buyers highly regarded Braun's German heritage. They cleverly used a trade loophole, where only a certain percentage of production must be performed by advertised country of manufacture. To get as many German hands to handle the Chinese-fabricated product - P&G even employs Lufthansa Freight, for Air and Hapag-Lloyd, for Sea/Rail shipping and transport. They reduced production costs by half, fabricating EVERYTHING in China....yet, they continued to raise shaver prices. There you have it...",A209D39LSIHOHO,4.0,5.0,4.0

Thymes Goldleaf Perfumed Body Wash 270ml/9.25oz,5.0,"A local gift boutique carries the complete line of Thymes and I regularly try out their products. It can result in problems because I want to sample everything. Thymes, while probably lesser known than Crabtree and Evelyn, offers a  lot of quality products and a  great variety of scents.
The Goldleaf Body Wash is like taking a walk through a spring garden. It produces a rich lather that hydrates your skin and leaves it feeling silky and smooth while cleansing thoroughly. It also leaves a slightly sweet smell that is subtle and fresh. Love it for the end results and pure luxury that it provides.",A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,5.0,5.0,4.0

"Crest Whitestrips Pro Effects,10-Day Dental Whitening Formula System, 40 Strips (Packaging May Vary)",4.0,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth. However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions exactly as specified inside the box.

1. First brush your teeth with a wet toothbrush to remove the layer of plaque (toothpaste is unnecessary). Rinse your teeth well with water.  Tooth enamel has pores, and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate.

2. Use the strips as directed on the box.  The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide; (in-office, or dentist-assisted dental whitening uses a 15-35% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white. Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2. Leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth, as this leads to sensitivity.

Disadvantages

1. Hydrogen Peroxide can ""burn"" your gums. If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn). Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to want to stop the treatment. It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal. Once they are healed, resume treatment with the White Strips. Try to not get the strip on your gums.

2. Your teeth may become senstiive during the week treatment time. Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off. You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc.  The peroxide causes an inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.  If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching.

3. The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach. You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth. Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal. However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.

4. The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains. If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.

Now comes the confusing part: Crest White Strips come in 4 different packages, each a bit different than the others.  The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  Here are the 4 packages:  1. Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  2. Crest White Strips Premium (10% hydrogen peroxide, 7-day treatment).  3. Crest White Strips Premium Plus (10% hydrogen peroxide, and has 12 additional strips).  4. Crest White Strips Renewal (9.5% hydrogen peroxide).  The cheapest method (at around 25 dollars, is the Crest Classic Whitestrips, but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment).  Premium and Premium Pro are both 10% peroxide formulations, work in 7-10 days, and the ""Premuim-Plus"" gives you 12 additional strips.  I am not sure why Crest recently came out with ""Renewal"", as it is a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10% concentration. Leave it to the manufacturer to confuse the consumer!

Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.  White Strips don't work as fast as a dentist-made custom tray bleaching, (or in-office bleaching) but over time, you will get a result that will be close to that of a dentist, and you will save money too.

I recommend starting with with either the Classic or the Premium-Pro. The Classic works in 2 weeks and is about $1.80 a day.  The Premium Pro works in 10 days and is about $2 dollars a day.  The Premium and Premium Pro are likely to give you more sensitivity than the Classic.  Be sure and check out the price of each kit, as they vary from store to store.  Obviously, get the cheapest kit that supplies the same amount of strips.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching using a custom-tray system or in-office bleaching.  This is much more expensive, but the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is much higher and this works better on stubbornly-stained teeth.

Philips Norelco 9170XLCC Smart Touch XL Shaver,3.0,"I am giving this 3 stars although mine is broken.  Let me tell you about the good first.  The cleaning system is pretty cool, and works well.  I just wish the liquid didn't evaporate so quickly.    But it being part alcohol - that makes sense that it evaporates.  The shave is close, although rough on the skin.  The head doesn't move as smoothly along my face as my old norelco.  Another positive is that is uses the same recharging cable as my old norelco (I think all norelco chargers are the same).

Now the bad.  At home, this razor was perfect.  It has about 80 minutes of juice in it and i only need to charge it about once every 3 months, since I have a secondary norelco I keep in my gym bag and use that one when I'm at work.  My secondary battery finally wouldn't hold a charge, so I had to replace it with my new 9170XLCC.  Well, every time I would take it out of my gym bag, the head would be popped open.  This is because the button to open the head actually sticks out from the body, and anything can snag it and it will spring open.  You don't even need to 'press' the button, you just need to touch it.  Well, today it was, as usual, popped open.  The only difference now is that it won't close.  It probably twisted a little while in the open position and now the blades are unaligned with the head, and it won't snap shut.  I can get a piece of tape and tape it shut, which works, but that is not the point.  Norelco had done a great job before by creating a recessed button on my old razor, but now this button that sticks out can snag on anything.  Not only is it bad in the sense that the head can twist when popped open, but I also have little hairs all over the bottom of my bag because it kept popping open.

So that's my review - it worked as a razor, but don't plan on travelling with it.  Even when you place it in a glove box/cupholder, that head will manage to pop open.  It was a poor design flaw and I'm very disappointed that norelco would send something out like this without any type of travel-testing.  I mean, what's the point of a cordless razor if you can't take it anywhere with you?",AGEKVD8JPZQMT,3.0,3.0,4.0

I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Yardley By Yardley Of London Unisexs Lay It On Thick Hand &amp; Foot Cream 5.3 Oz,5.0,"Having given up on bar soap and its innate ability to dry my skin out, I have been using shower gel for years.  Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.",A3N81O636W6H9A,4.942065491183879,5.0,4.0

I first found it online by doing a search for things with pumpkin in it, and now I'm on my 4th bottle of this and I also recommend the body lotion and face creams, I am slowly becoming totally enamored with this brand and always look forward to trying more things.

This wash beats soap anytime in the shower; the orange gelee collapses on itself when poured and feels cool and refreshing especially in the morning. I love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. There is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing Dead Sea water and even spirulina extract, which I have drank before but never used in products. It feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. The bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.

As I get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. Parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately I keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy. And I love my cosmetics almost as much as books, the bathroom is always stacked : )

Philips Norelco 9160XL SmartTouch-XL Men's Shaver,4.0,"Hi, My name is Michael.  I live near Baton Rouge, LA.  I'm 43 and I have shaved with Norelco Electric Razors for years.  I had 3 SpectraXLs that went out within a month of shaving.  I also had a Cool Skin that went out within a month of shaving.  Norelco replaced the Spectras and I have a 8894XL that I have been shaving with for about 6 months and it works fine.  I took the money that I got back from the Cool Skin and put it towards a Smart Touch 9160XL.  I was really surprised to learn that Norelco was discontinuing the Spectra line.  8894XL is one fine shaving machine, beautiful design and well constructed, with the kinks ironed out, it's the best shaving electric razor Norelco has ever made up to now.  I say up to now.  Smart Touch is not the razor that Spectra is.  It is cheaply made and not as well constructed.  To me, Norelco has made a step backwards by discontinuing Spectra, but Smart Touch does slightly out shave Spectra and that is the main reason to buy this razor.  I have a heavy dark beard and I work 12 hour shifts at the end of my day with Smart Touch, I hardly have a shadow, AWESOME!!!!!  Something, I've never experienced with an electric razor!!!!  9160XL is good enough, unless you want to put down about $200 more for all the bells and whistles, when 9160XL shaves just as good as 9190XL.  I usually use Williams Electric Shave, but this morning I used some Pinaud Clubman Talc as a pre electric and I got the closest shave that I have ever gotten with an electric razor!!!!  Pos.- There are 3 heads on this Razor ( Something that Spectra does not have ), making for a closer shave, It has a personal comfort control with 3 settings, line bar to show you how much charge you have left, and it can be eaisly washed out after each shave, and it give the closest possible shave that you will ever  get with an electric razor.  Neg.- This razor is not of the same qualty as Spectra.  It is cheaply made and not as awesome as Spectra.  The cleaning indicator is useless.  It blinks after every shave, not when the razor needs to be cleaned.  The little travel pouch is a joke!!  The razor barely fits in it.  I almost took mine back, but I stuck with it for a couple of days and found that I really was getting the closest shave that I had ever gotten with an electric razor, so I kept mine.  Go ahead and buy this razor.  Don't waste your money on the higher priced models.  I'm sure this one shaves just as good, but be sure to save your sales slip in case it goes out.

Celine Oriental Summer By Celine For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces,5.0,"Hyaluronic Acid has become the obligatory active ingredient in any anti-ageing formulation deserving of its name, however, the variations are limitless.  In this version, sent to me for evaluation and review, the pure ingredient comes in the form of an almost odourless, fairly liquid, clear gel that is easily absorbed by my skin.  But, more importantly, this serum instantly and visibly tightens my skin (you could call it a face lift effect) and causes the cream or lotion that I apply on top to be swallowed up in a way I have seldom seen.  I know from experience how much moisturizer my face can drink up with, or without, a serum.  This product makes my skin twice as thirsty!  I could not believe it the first time, I thought my face must be particularly dry.  But now I see that it is a feature of this product, as I regularly need to follow up with twice as much as normal of my chosen skin care.  The result is a visibly more nourished face and neck and a noticeable smoothing of the lines and wrinkles around eyes and mouth.

The bottle is dark and stylish, elongated to accommodate a sizeable glass dropper.  While this allows precise dispensing, it is difficult to get the last of the gel out of the bottle.  Also the dark, opaque finish makes it impossible to see how much product is left, so I have no idea when I need to buy the next bottle.  Anyway, that is my only minor criticism of an otherwise excellent product.  The bottle contains 30 ml (or a little over 1 ounce) of serum, which is pretty standard for this class of skin care.  At the current price of just under $45, this compares very favourably with similar products which are not nearly as effective.

With age, my skin has become fragile and ultra sensitive to harsh ingredients.  This serum has not caused any irritation, redness or other adverse reaction, even applied to the tender skin around the eyes.  In fact, my face feels refreshed and toned after I apply it, and more than ready to absorb the product that follows.  I think it bears repeating that a serum is a carrier, it facilitates absorption of whatever you choose to put on your skin afterwards.  A seriously proactive serum like this one should not be applied by itself.  Depending on your age and the state of your skin, you can choose the potency of the moisturizer that follows.  In my case, I often layer two products and I find that this serum easily allows both to sink in where they have a chance to do some good.  Top quality serum which gives immediately visible results and more durable ones over time.",A234YLAS2MYYWA,5.0,5.0,4.0

"Rainbow Light - MintAsure Fresh Breath Capsules, Powerful Support for Healthy Teeth and Gums and Lasting Minty Breath with Parsley Oil and Xylitol, Vegetarian Sugar-Free, Lactose-Free, 75 Capsules",5.0,"These don't work for everyone, but they work for most people I know who I have suggested use them.

Update October 11, 2016- I started the Atkins diet. For anyone who has been on Atkins, you know this means bad breath and foul body odor as the body excretes ketones. Ick. Double ick. I have job interviews to attend and I can't show up smelling like a cesspit. These are helping keep my body odor free. My only negative thought about them is the coating flakes off if they are stored long term or banged around in a purse. It doesn't lessen their effect, but it does make them a bit messy.

These work on me by removing the smell of onions or alcohol seeping out my pores and my breath. I take a dose before stinky food or drink and then again around two hours later. I generally take three doses the first day then another dose the next morning.

There are some meals that are full of onions and garlic. I don't want to smell like sour onions or garlic for three days. These help resolve the issue. Most of the time these pills can at least lessen the smell exuding from my pores and stop the bad breath. For me, and for the few people I have had try them, they work.

They saved at least one relationship I had where the man had a major problem with eating onions or garlic. He could come home after eating those for lunch and I would smell it on his skin. Not on his breath, literally on his skin. The Mint Asure helped keep that from happening and within around an hour of taking the pills, the smell exuding from him would lessen.  I have been a fan of these since they were called ""Breath Assure"".

The new mint coating does make them harder to take without water, but taking them with water seems to help get them into the system faster so I don't mind it. I don't find that the mint coating does much to freshen breath on it's own.

Don't know why they work, but I am glad they do!

The sticky stuff added to the capsules is a bonus, suck it off then swallow. I can dry swallow many pills but these need liquid to swallow. They work fast, within an hour on me.",A1MF83RMFXN6TF,4.666666666666667,5.0,4.0
"Rainbow Light - MintAsure Fresh Breath Capsules, Powerful Support for Healthy Teeth and Gums and Lasting Minty Breath with Parsley Oil and Xylitol, Vegetarian Sugar-Free, Lactose-Free, 75 Capsules",5.0,"When these pills first came out over a decade ago, I was a skeptic. I was also suffering from living with a man who exuded the smell of garlic and onions from his pores for 24-48 hours after eating them. I was tired of gagging around him, and of knowing he had consumed onions or garlic while at work. I saw this product and purchased it.

What happened next was like a miracle. He would swallow these pills as soon after eating as possible, then again before bed time and at least once more the next day. The smell coming from his pores and his breath was gone. I was able to be in the room with him where before I was gagging every time I got within a few feet of him. (Trust me when I say not being able to be close to your fella ruins the relationship a bit!)

These pills work, I use them, I suggest them to my friends as well. These are the pills that really work to eliminate the smells. It works on onions, garlic and also with alcohol. Since finding these pills, I now always keep a supply of them back stocked at home. They work, they work fast and they are something I hope is on the market for the rest of my life.",A1MF83RMFXN6TF,4.666666666666667,5.0,4.0
Philips Norelco BG2020 BodyGroom,4.0,"This product works exactly as it says it will.  I was pretty skeptical, but it gives a close shave with minimal irritation.  And no exposed blades to snag sensitve bits.
Being able to use it in or out of the shower is a real plus, though it seems to work better dry.

Update:
With the amount of hair I have, I guess it's no surprise that this thing won't last a life time.  I dropped my first BG one too many times in the shower and it finally gave out.
Of course this product is so great at what it does, that it was a no brainer to replace it.
The only complaint I have about the BodyGroom is how delicate the foil guard is.  It is very easy to get bent or dented, and when that happens, you can get some unexpected snagging from the cutting blades.  The best way to prevent any damage to the foil (which incidentally, is not covered by the warranty), is to be very careful when removing and disassembling the unit to clean it.

Now in terms of performance--this thing can plow through a lot of hair, but works better if you keep up with your trimming regularly.  If you are doing a particular hairy part, like your legs, clip them dry and be sure to tap out the hair that gets caught up in the shaver head regularly.

The guards are basically useless and will frustrate you if you are trying to do any type of styling (say, shaved down to the skin on your torso, but leaving a little longer happy trail).  More times than not, I just ditch the guards and take it all o

Philips Norelco BG2020 BodyGroom,5.0,"I like this shaver because nothing else worked for getting the back of my neck.  My regular clippers (I cut my own hair) don't get those types of hairs close to the skin.  Shaving with a razor irritates that part of the body.  This bodygroom shaver takes care of it without irritation.

Philips Norelco BG2020 BodyGroom,4.0,"We've had this for about 2 1/2 years and all of a sudden it won't turn on.  The charger light came on, then off after a while as if it had charged, but nothing happened when we pushed the switch.  When it worked it held a charge through many uses.

I'm not too upset by the death of my Bodygroom - while I had hoped it would last longer it wasn't very expensive to start with so I'll order another one.  Why?  Because it gets the job done.

Yes, the guard clogs with hair quickly.  That's why I use it in the shower...makes cleanup much easier!  If I trim too quickly the guard comes off but fortunately I haven't shaved a bare swath across my chest...yet.

As for the more sensitive areas, well, it works well there too without pain - if you're careful.  It's easy to get the wrong angle and have the trimmer blade (that cuts with the guard) contact skin.  Work slowly to ensure only the center touches skin.

It's not perfect but it works great for taming unruly chest hair, and if you prefer a smoother look elsewhere, well, it can take care of that too.",A141OPVE376YFI,3.7777777777777777,4.0,4.0

Philips Norelco BG2020 BodyGroom,1.0,"Like many of the other reviewers of the BG2020 I am shocked at how many positive reviews this little trimmer has received.

I've been using a standard corded Wahl trimmer off and on for a number of years to keep certain areas of body hair in check without hassle. When I saw this Philips-Norelco body hair trimmer as the deal of the day here at Amazon I jumped at the opportunity. For one thing thinking that this trimmer was specifically designed for more coarse body hair I figured it would make grooming easier. Secondly the unit is cordless which is always easier.

So a few days after my trimmer arrived I stepped into the shower planning on making a quick trim before heading out with some friends. The first thing I notice is that this trimmer feels cheap. Everything from the trimmer to the attachment heads is made from cheap plastic. The trimmer doesn't feel like it has the weight to cut through hair and once I started trimming my suspicions were spot-on accurate. The BG2020 is more of a hair-puller than trimmer.

I ended up having to repeatedly pass the BG2020 over certain areas which inevitably leads to irritation. I thought maybe it works better with shower turned on and wet. Wrong again.

So I ended up chucking this thing in a bathroom drawer and I honestly don't plan on ever using it again. What a waste of $30. If you have anything more than peach fuzz I would recommend staying away!",A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,3.7777777777777777,1.0,4.0
Philips Norelco BG2020 BodyGroom,5.0,"I think it's probably illegal in some states to be this excited about a shaver, but I am literally freaking out about how amazing this product is!

If you've ever tried shaving your groin with a straight up razor you know how impossible it is to get a good clean look without at least some kind of irritation and hideous bumps.  The bodygroom is my savior!  Before the ceremony took hours of delicate precision, with this bad boy I can brush my teeth, talk on the phone, shampoo my hair, and shave my sack at the same time!  I've never experienced any kind of razor burn or nicks from using it, and I've explored the boundaries and took them to the limit! It even reduces the itchy feeling to almost nothing!

Other than the groin, I enjoy using my norelco for the old arm pits, weird nipple hairs, and anywhere else unwanted hair might grow.  It's tough stuff, not a jungle in sight that it can't take down.

Now even with all this praise I don't know that I should recommend it or not, as I just discovered they released the&nbsp;Philips Norelco BG2030 Professional BodyGrooming System&nbsp;that might actually be better.  I will definitely be ordering that one soon to test the differences, but in the mean time - you need at least one of the Bodygroomers, whether this one or the latest edition.

Philips Norelco BG2020 BodyGroom,1.0,"This item is very cheaply made.  The foil is only held in by four pin head-size ""dots"" while snapping into the head.  Also, the combs attach in a very similar snap-on and hold with dot concept.  They are difficult to get on/off.  I have only used this maybe ten times, and now the foil starts falling out all the time.  The dots fail to hold it any more.

Without the combs, it is too ""dangerous"" for trimming sensitive areas.  With the combs, it is too clunky/bulky, and you have to go over the area about ten times.  I found an old electric Wahl-type trimmer (with combs) works a lot better and faster.  Finally, the charger base is a stupid waste of space and plastic and often the contacts don't work unless you really pay attention or jiggle it.  A conventional plug would have been a lot better.

I also have the Philips Norelco grooming kit and really like that one, but this cost me almost triple, and it is falling apart after much less usage.",A2EHYCA29NSQLU,3.7777777777777777,1.0,4.0

"QUEEN HELENE Professional Cleansing Cream, Triple Whipped, 15 oz",3.0,"I originally bought this cleansing cream to remove makeup and dirt like a cold cream. I have been stripping my face using harsh cleansers and wanted to ease up yet still get rid of makeup at night. This cream kind of confuses me. It does seem to remove makeup, including mascara and liner, well. But then I end up having to wash my face after because it leaves an oily residue which is not good for my skin. It's mineral oil  which is like a barrier which keeps moisture out but, at the same time, keeps it in as well.  It forms a sort of seal between your skin and anything you put on it and anything that is under it. Anyone who is prone to clogged pores will probably break out if they leave this on their skin.

However, this brand is certainly not the only cream cleanser to use mineral oil as its main hydrator and cleanser. When I use this Queen Helene Cream, I always rinse it off so I am still washing my face like I was but at least the product is hydrating and not harsh. It doesn't strip my face of its natural oils and, when I wash it off with a warm washcloth, my face feels soft.

But what I really wanted was a no rinse cleanser for those lazy nights when I want to remove make up and dirt and hydrate all in one step. I may be able to leave this on my skin and not have issues but I prefer to remove the oil and use something a little more aging skin friendly. Still, if you're looking for a creamy cleanser that gets the job done and is cheap, this does work. I will use what I have but I don't think I will replace it when it is gone.",A331BHAR0TRLWT,3.0,3.0,4.0
"Queen Helene Cocoa Butter, Solid, 5.75 Ounce [Packaging May Vary]",2.0,"*Edited to add that the pictures of the ingredients label were not on the page when I bought this product.*

This is by no means solid coca butter. It has *some* cocoa butter in it but it's a ways down the ingredients list. It is more mineral oil,  petroleum. and paraffin which are the first three ingredients. It is very solid, like a candle. In fact, I dumped the tub over accidentally and the whole thing fell out of the tub in one solid piece. I picked it up and put it back in. It looks like a candle, yellow and nearly opaque. It is very greasy and very, very hard. You can't dip your finger into the tub and scoop some out. You have to sort of scrape the sides to get some of the waxy stuff out of there.

On my skin, it is greasy. It has a great scent though I must say. I guess it's cocoa buttery. The fragrance is artificial. I bought this cream for my hands as they are really dry in the winter but this is way too greasy for use anytime but at night with gloves on. It does remove makeup on my face decently although it is certainly not my preferred method. It's not bad on my lips but has a strange taste. I am desperately trying to find a use for this stuff. I think that the description should be much clearer because this simply is NOT cocoa butter at all. It is misleading to label it that way. I have been using this Queen Helene .. stuff on my hands at night and also have used it to remove makeup, on my lips, and also around my eyes for a jolt of hydration but really, I don't know quite what to do with it.

Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System,5.0,"At this point with so many reviews of this trimmer there is not really much I can add that will be too helpful I'm afraid.  Suffice it to say that this is a very well priced shaver/trimmer that has all the attachments one could want for everything from trimming hair, to that of your nose and ears as well.  It's small, easy to hold and handle, and shaped in such a way that makes even doing ones back of the neck easy.  It charges up quickly and lasts long enough to do several trimming jobs before you need to plug it in again.  About the only couple of things I can say I don't like about this trimmer is there is no stand that comes with it for storing it upright in between charges. (but they do give you a little nylon bag to store all the attachments in). That wouldn't be so bad, save for the fact that the trimmers bottom is very small and it tips over easily when you just set it down upright.  It would have been nice if they either offered a little stand to store it in, or made the base of the unit a little bigger for stability.  The other is a minor irritant, but one that I am sure many will well identify with.  The instruction booklet is not a booklet at all but one of those big thin fold out papers like the the old road maps.  Its in 40 languages like everything is these days and its very difficult to read it when all spread out and follow it in English or any other language.  And trust me, you should read the instructions on this before just trying it out.  It helps with getting used to how the different heads attach and are most efficient.  All in all however despite these two minor issues this is a very reasonably priced trimmer that will do the job nicely for most of us, and I recommend it...",A35W3JQYP0M655,5.0,5.0,4.0
Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System,5.0,"This Norelco ""G370 All-in-1 Grooming System"" has held up remarkably well with fairly heavy usage over the past three years. I keep a very short beard and mustache (see my ""Profile"" picture) so do a trim every two or three days. Since I am also getting older, there is now a lot more hair where there aught not to be hair (ears, nose, eyebrows, etc) and fortunately this set has attachments to handle all of those needs.

The set comes with the handy caddy tray that holds the attachments and the charger cord can be connected through the bottom so the trimmer recharges when it is seated. The trimmer can easily run through three or four of my sessions without needing to be recharged, which is great when traveling since it is often not necessary to bring my whole kit along.

My only real issue with the trimmer is that with the spacer attached the hair gets crammed down in between the attachment and trimmer body, making it messy to clean out.

Highly Recommended!

Philips Norelco 7240XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver,5.0,"I resisted Norelcos for over 40 years because, frankly, I thought the rotary head looked ""dorky""--especially compared to the more masculine, phallic, lance-like Remingtons and Schicks.  Then I tried the least expensive Norelco model and experienced a completely clean shave for the first time in my life.  I was happy with that model, but it's managed to disappear, leading me to the 7240XL, which Amazon inexplicably had priced at $15-20 below the ""less deluxe,"" cosmetically blue 7140XL.  Small wonder that they sold out.  You may wish to wait to see if it's restocked at its former price, or simply elect to pay the higher freight.

This Norelco is more shaver than I need--slightly heavier and bigger than my previous, entry-level model, and it has a curious but I assume functional plastic ""shield"" (hair-catcher?).  Also, the trimmer is noisier (and ""sounds"" less powerful) than its predecessor.  But it delivers the same flawless performance and has niceties such as water-wash clean (I hardly dare to use it), adjustability to the curvature of the face, and automatic voltage selection.  The less expensive models offer the same, though the 7240XL is slightly more ""ergonomic"" (with the inclusion of a thumb and finger rest).  If you can forego the thumb rest and live with blue instead of silver, the 7140XL will serve you just as well, I'm sure, and currently at a significantly lower price (Amazon apparently caught on and adjusted the formerly upside-down pricing of the two models).",A6FIAB28IS79,5.0,5.0,4.0
Philips Norelco 7140 Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver,4.0,"This is a pretty glamorous shaver, but as I write, Amazon has it priced 20-30% higher than the more ""efficient and advanced""  Norelco 7240XL.  Not that this one is expensive, but the 7240XL is an outstanding deal at present.  Basically, the differences are purely external and cosmetic.  The 7140 is blue, the 7240 is grey; the 7140 has a catch-as-catch-can grip, the 7240 has an ergonomic pistol grip.  If you're Hopalong Cassidy, the 7140 designer blue is your defense against the enemy of errant forestry; if you're Neal Cassady, the 7240 is your ""Further"" for flying across the free and flagrant fields of stubble and heath.

[Footnote to the grandchildren of the boomers: ""Further"" was the psychedelic school bus Ken Kesey created for Neal Cassady's travels, celebrated by Tom Wolfe in ""The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test"" (like Norelco electric shavers, still selling quite briskly on Amazon after all these years.  Moreover, unlike the hippies of the sixties, the Beatnik generation from whence Cassady came actually shaved!).  Hopalong Cassidy (aka William Boyd), on the other hand, was a screen cowboy--a contemporary of Roy Rogers and Gene Autry, distinguished from them by his white hair matched to his white horse (whereas Trigger and Champion were colored).  Also, unlike Roy and Gene, Hopalong didn't sing.]",A6FIAB28IS79,4.0,4.0,4.0
Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer,4.0,"I own an earlier model, which I prefer, but the battery died. The hair catcher was a cup that could be removed and be easily dumped into a waste basket; this model has a fragile door, the hairs do not easily come out or off of the filter and tapping the unit could damage it. Both shavers require a light pressure or the setting can suddenly change to a shorter length.  Turbo speed is really not necessary. Nice 70 minute charge, comfortable to hold, and attractive style.  Overall, I feel it will work well but I am leary of the shavings door. It does a nice job, as I expected. I have no experience with any other brand to compare.  I suggest a can of compressed air be handy and to blow the shavings out after each use, which defeats the neatness of the vacuum collection, but blow lightly over a waste basket.",A2V1J3JT5OOZFO,4.0,4.0,4.0
Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer,4.0,"I bought this trimmer for my husband because it's so annoying to see all the little hairs on the sink after he trims his mustache, sideburns, etc.  This unit has a handy little vacuum inside of it that gets almost all of the stray hairs.  For me, that's a 5 star feature.  My husband's only complaint is that it's a little bulky because of this feature and that when he wants to trim around his mustache or ears he can't just pull off the plastic guard like he could with his old Panasonic so the blades are exposed, but has to replace the guard with a smaller head that has exposed blades that made for this purpose.

Some reviewers have complained about the noise but to me it seems about average as far as sound goes.  It doesn't wake me up if the bathroom door is open to the bedroom and I'm still asleep.  Whatever extra noise is probably due to the vacuum feature.  So we'd say that while it's not perfect, it's a pretty good trimmer.",A3S3R88HA0HZG3,4.0,4.0,4.0
Philips Norelco 7110 Cordless Rechargeable Shaver,5.0,"After about 3 years this razor is still giving consistently good and close shaves and the battery is still just as good as the day I got it. I switched to electric razors a few years ago when my face couldn't handle blades anymore. I thought I'd have to sacrifice a close shave in order to get a healthier face but this hasn't been the case with this shaver. The shave is almost as close as a blade and I have absolutely no irritation. I upgraded to one of the speed XL models and this one is slightly slower, but not so bad.

There are only 2 downsides: It takes 8 hours to charge and you can't use it corded. This is not that big of a deal though since you'll still have plenty of time to finish when the low battery indicator goes off.

At this point I couldn't recommend this shaver if you have already used a rotary and know you like them and for a very simple reason: it is obsolete and buying replacement heads is almost as much as a new razor. However, if you are looking for a traveling razor or want to give rotaries a shot then this might be the right choice. A few years ago I would have highly recommended it.",A2UHXPMDDHRFC9,4.0,5.0,4.0
Philips Norelco 7110 Cordless Rechargeable Shaver,3.0,"I bought this directly from Amazon about a week ago for a blowout price.  It already looks like Amazon is not selling this item anymore as it is currently only listed as available from various Marketplace sellers.

For the three ten-spots I paid, I'm satisfied.  It basically cost what replacement blades for my other shaver cost.  I will say that this shaver doesn't appear to have the same quality of build as my last Norelco.  It is lighter, doesn't feel as good in the hand, and has a cheap plastic feel.  The motor sounds like it's less powerful than my older model (which listed for a similar full retail price when new); even with a full charge it doesn't sound like the blades and spinning around very fast.  That being said, the thing isn't particularly quiet either.

Gives an adequate if mediocre shave.  Requires lots of passes over the same area of skin in order to get everything.  All in all not a terrible buy, but not a great find either.",A2TO2BN3P4C00L,4.0,3.0,4.0

Fruits &amp; Passion Blue Refreshing Shower Gel - 6.7 fl. oz.,5.0,"This is just divine. I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried. I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

Fruits &amp; Passion Blue Refreshing Shower Gel - 6.7 fl. oz.,5.0,"This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed!  Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Fruits &amp; Passion Blue Refreshing Shower Gel - 6.7 fl. oz.,5.0,"Having given up on bar soap and its innate ability to dry my skin out, I have been using shower gel for years.  Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.",A3N81O636W6H9A,4.942065491183879,5.0,4.0

I would be lying if I said I wasn't also attracted to it because it's my favorite color, purple. Softsoap is also pretty reasonable, price wise, so I don't feel bad buying more than one bottle at a time.

This one, thankfully, leaves my skin nothing but silky smooth and smelling wonderful!

Last thing I'll mention is how I love that this body wash does not dry out my skin.  I have very dry skin, and usually the combination of a hot shower and body wash leaves my skin red and itchy.

Fruits &amp; Passion Blue Refreshing Shower Gel - 6.7 fl. oz.,5.0,"I love this brand because the ingredients are all good enough to eat, its Paraben free and best of all, no animal testing. I first found it online by doing a search for things with pumpkin in it, and now I'm on my 4th bottle of this and I also recommend the body lotion and face creams, I am slowly becoming totally enamored with this brand and always look forward to trying more things.

This wash beats soap anytime in the shower; the orange gelee collapses on itself when poured and feels cool and refreshing especially in the morning. I love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. There is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing Dead Sea water and even spirulina extract, which I have drank before but never used in products. It feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. The bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.

As I get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. Parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately I keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy. And I love my cosmetics almost as much as books, the bathroom is always stacked : )

This shower gel by Solstis is really unique; it smells like no other cosmetic I have ever used. Sure many items will try and smell like an ocean, with the wet green blue artificial scent, yet they do not compare to this one.

This wash smells like the salty ocean water, sunscreen lotion, sun, sand and a slight layer of milky fruit. It's really radiant and silky on and has the most incredible fresh scent; it makes me feel as if I have entered a paradise island and Im watching the sunset settling in misty colored sweet clouds as waves crash at my feet as I have never used a product that smelled this unique.

"Aqua Velva After Shave, Classic Ice Blue, 3.5 Ounce",5.0,"HEY!! I am an Aqua Velva Man and absolutely love this stuff, been using it for over 50 years. This is a true after shave lotion classic. Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.

There slogan was "" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.

Note :::; Some reviewers mention this 7oz size now comes in a plastic container, I just bought one in Wal-Mart and it was glass.",A2UEO5XR3598GI,4.315789473684211,5.0,4.0
"Aqua Velva After Shave, Classic Ice Blue, 3.5 Ounce",5.0,"This stuff will never go out of style.  Cool astringent qualities on applcation . . . then a lingering very fresh, very masculine scent(and not at all overwhelming or offensive).

Working against this product are the same things that work for it:  It has been around forever and it is cheap.  Therefore snobs won't touch it.

My favorite after shave.

By the way -- my present supply is in a plastic container labeled, ""New Shatterproof Bottle!"".  #1. I really don't think the marketers care if it's shatterproof or not.  They want to improve profit margin.  The plastic is ok, but if there was a choice . . . I'd take glass.  #2  Whoever designed and then signed off on this horrid bottle should be fired. I suspect in the interest of getting the consumer to use more, the hole in the top of the bottle is too big.

This product--and several other products offered through the company NEOTERIC (all under the Alpha Hydrox brand)--are exactly the answer I've been looking for.  I've used them both alone and in conjunction with a more expensive brand of anti-aging products (for which I've also left good reviews on this site), and I can see great improvements both ways.

I decided to try this brand of alpha hydroxy cream after reading in Dr. Oz's (and Dr. Roizen's) book&nbsp;You: Staying Young: The Owner's Manual for Extending Your Warranty (You).  I'd tried several other alpha hydroxy products before this one (i.e. ROC, etc.) and must say this particular line (ALPHA HYDROX) is far superior to any other I've used.  That it is also apparently considerably less expensive than most is icing on the cake, in my book.

Regarding this product, I find the key is to use it AT LEAST once a day, and always after using a mild cleanser.  At my age I still get acne and, despite my sometimes manic picking, I notice it (and any residual puffiness or redness, and resulting scarring) clears up much, much more quickly than it used to.  Also, my skin breaks out much less than before I used this.  The tone and color of my skin are far improved when compared to prior to using this product.  I've run out of it before and tried to use something else until I was able to locate more locally, and to my dismay the condition of my skin began to deteriorate.

I won't try to insult anyone by saying the Alpha Hydrox line will remove every wrinkle or fix all your skincare woes.  If there is a product out there that does this, I want to know!  But for now, this is by far the best line of products I've used.  I use this item, particularly, with the line of skincare I reviewed previously, as that seems to address reversing the signs of aging better (where this one, for me, just improves the overall condition and appearance of my skin).",A35LMHYDT1ZR5Y,4.5,5.0,4.0

I am 54, I have gaps between all my teeth where food gets in and if I don't take the food out; it'll definitely give me horrible breath! The dentist told me that in the back of your tongue (near tonsils) there are hole pockets; as you get older, they get bigger and if you don't brush your tongue; you'll get bad breath. Brushing behind the back teeth helps, too. I use to watch my dentist when he'd cleaning my teeth with floss (during dentist cleanings). Its very embarrassing when people wrap their hands over their mouths because your breath is offensive. Oh, this dental tape doesn't make my teeth bleed either. The other thin flosses; are too sharp and make my teeth bleed but not this one. I cannot find dentotape at my local store (W...) so I have to order it here. I also recommend Biotene (a mouth rinse) by GlaxoSmithKline. The biotene rinse helps get rid of food particles; where brushing isn't enough. No more trips to the dentists since we started using these great products and no more bad breath.",ACTVXNBEPLW2S,5.0,5.0,4.0
"REACH Dentotape Waxed Tape, Unflavored 100 Yards",5.0,"As a dentist, I have seen over and over again the destructive results of not flossing one's teeth. The unfortunate result of such neglect is the rapid development of cavities between the teeth (especially in kids), and inevitable gum disease in adults, which can lead to eventual tooth loss.  Gum disease almost always starts in-between the teeth, and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities between the teeth is with floss.  Mechanical scrubbing with floss is the key, and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not remove the in-between stubborn plaque below the gumline and at the contact point of the teeth. The bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep them for a lifetime.

Reach floss is thicker than the average floss. It will be more difficult to pass between teeth, but I like it because I find that it cleans my teeth better than the smaller diameter floss. This is a personal preference not based on any clinical data. Reach floss is not for everyone. Those with tight contacts will have trouble with Reach floss. This floss is waxed (easier to slide between teeth), and is unflavored.

If one's fingers get sore from flossing, there are various floss forks that one can load with this floss.  Using a floss fork is very effective and handy, as one does not have to get fingers in the mouth. Here is a good one I recommend:&nbsp;Flossaid Dental Floss Holder **ONE**

Floss each tooth contact with a gentle insertion of the floss between the teeth.  Gently scrub each tooth up and down and make sure to go under the gumline (as this is where gum disease germs get their start).  After flossing, it is a great time to brush.  Always use a fluoridated toothpaste for maximum protection of the teeth (fluoride makes the enamel crystal more resistant to acid destruction).

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"After extensive dental work including a seven tooth upper implant, I found flossing impracticable. My dentist suggested using this unit twice a day, and after two months it works perfectly.

It was a little tricky learning to start it in my mouth and then letting the water drizzle out without splattering, but time and habit solved everything.

Just had my three month checkup and everything was sparkling clean around both the implant and my remaining teeth.

One small amusement: the carrying case has holders for four tips but the unit comes with six. Luckily the fifth wheel, as it were, fits in the carrying case even though there is no slot for it.

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,2.0,"I have been using this after meals since I have braces. It helps remove all the food that gets stuck around the brackets. Other than that, I don't think it is that great. The orthodontist said the priority should be flossing and brushing, not the Waterpik. He said the Waterpik does not have enough pressure to remove plaque. This is really just for getting the big chunks of food before I brush and floss with Oral-B Superfloss.
Before I got braces, I occasionally used the Waterpik but I can't say it did much for me.
It has been a year and I have noticed a puddle of water around the Waterpik after I turn it off. I think the handle is now leaking.
After my braces come off I will probably throw the Waterpik away.

UPDATE: I was right. The handle does in fact leak. I could buy a replacement handle for $10 but I don't want to. Overall, the Waterpik lasted about a year, which is not acceptable for a $50 item.",A3M3CQS3287AEO,4.648648648648648,2.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"I bought this based largely on the features and the reviews on Amazon. The hand held WP-450 model has a 2-year warranty, but I've never had the batteries last for two years. Some don't make it to 18 months. The one I bought a year ago now only lasts for about 4 or 5 sessions before the charge dies. I recharge them for over 24 yours when they get week, which is what Waterpik recommends. So I have two so I can use one while the other one charges. Got tired of all this and got this plug in model and I wish I had done this several years ago. Being tethered to the hose is not a problem at all, the hand unit is much lighter and more maneuverable than the battery model, lighter too. I use this on #7 setting on the dial and it is just about the same as my old 450 units with a fresh charge. The highest setting is really powerful! Control easy to use, uses the same tips as my old units. I floss first, lightly brush with a tooth brush, then use a Sonicare. After this routing my hygienist still found food under my gums during a routing cleaning! That is when I added the Waterpik to my routine and they never found food after that again. Amazing to see what flossing and brushing with a Sonicare leaves behind. I am 67 and my gums have receded, so I need the extra flushing power of a water flosser. Dental floss does not get down between the gum and base of the tooth. I recommend this for anyone who is either starting out with your first water flosser or using a rechargable unit that you don't want to replace every 18 months because the battery is failing. Extra tips store in the lid to the tank. Tank easy to remove for cleaning. Can even be washed in the dishwasher if you remove the rubber valve/plug unit. I love the design, tube coils up and stores in the side of the unit with the handle slipping in a holder, all tucked out of the way. My teeth feel super clean even 12  hours after using this wonderful machine. Well made with quality materials.",ALC78IZMOVRHN,4.648648648648648,5.0,4.0

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"For me, I have been using a cordless (non Waterpik brand) and while it has helped my gums, I wanted to step my gum treatment up a few notches so I purchased this Waterpik. It is TOTALLY AMAZING how well my gums are responding to this treatment. Here is a list below of the MANY PROS of this unit:

+ Effectiveness with my gums, teeth and mouth: After using this just a short time, my gums are getting more of that lighter pink and healthy look I need for my gum health. And they feel so clean after each use. In addition, my teeth even look cleaner! Love the fact that this has 10 different intensity levels. The one  five are very, very gentle on gums (great if you have tender or swollen gums or if you are new to Waterpik). However, I am up to power 8 on this and will be up to a 10 soon) and this intensity works wonderfully on my gums. They actually enjoy their beauty treatment so to speak.

+ Pause Button on the handle  This saves the day for me as when I want to pause, the button is at my fingertips and this helps me not to spray water all around my bathroom.

+ Ease of filling and cleaning - This unit is easy to fill, clean and empty and I like the fact that it is stationery in my bathroom and does not take much counter space.

+ Attachments and what is included  This comes with 6 attachments: Classic Jet Tip, Toothbrush Tip, Tongue Cleaner, Pik Pocket Tip (my favorite attachment as it is really helping my gums), Plaque Seeker Tip, and Orthodontic Tip.
In addition to the attachments, there is a Quick Start sheet to show you how to setup the Waterpik and also there is a small owners manual that has much information on how to use each attachment and how to overall use the Waterpik with pictures and step by steps.

+ Quality and Sound: This unit is almost whisper quiet as the motor is very smooth yet heavy duty at the same time. This is a very superbly made Waterpik!

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"Cons:
Loud, sounds like Barbie handling a concrete drill.
Constantly sprays. The spraying, doesn't stop unless you press the blue button. To me, that's backwards. It should turn on when I press the handle button, but the real on button is on the side. However, you get used to it quick after you sprayed water everywhere a few times :D.
Can't replace flossing (unfortunately you'd need a sandblaster to replace string flossing, and that would be painful.)
Your mouth will fill with water quickly, so you have to spit multiple times (really not a big deal but took time to get used to.)

Pros:
Your mouth feels dentist clean!
It's fun in a gadgety way.
Easy to setup. The coil on the handle NEVER tangles.

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,4.0,Despite the off switch making it so much nicer than the original ones over 20 years ago...but I still manage to spray myself and the walls. I found that it didn't want to start working..or pumping actually when I attemped to prime it so to speak as the directions tell you. I set it up for that and after many minutes nothing happening. HUH...I was aware others wrote in that it was dead on arrival. But I could hear the pump being actively trying to work...just no water. So I ever so slightly lifted the corner the pump hole is on the water canister facing the pik it's on your left side towards the front corner...anyway I lifted it just a real tiny amount like maybe less than 1/4 inch or even no more than an 1/8 even. And a couple bubbles came up and I set it back down seating it again and the water came through right after that. So it was an air lock. That simple and that simple a fix but sometimes an airlock might be larger than the few small bubbles I had emerge. So you might have to work it a bit  maybe even shake it back and forth gentle of course. This kind of information might be helpful and prevent returns in the future. But the sellers need to realize this and tell you or warn you in the descriptions. Also Really WATERPIK should have this in it's brochure or manual as it is and tell you right off that it can occur.

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"When i was 16 my dentist told me to buy a Waterpik as an alternative to flossing which I didn't like then or now. Many years have past and I have shot through quite a few Waterpik models and this is the current one I own. It is a little more evolved than its predecessors, but it still performs in pretty much the same way it always has. You fill the reservoir with water, attach the head to the handle which has a control to turn the water stream on and off, and then turn the device on to produce a spray of water as you move the head around to remove debris from between your teeth and gums. I think of the Waterpik as a power washer for the teeth and gums because it forces out pressurized water to irrigate those areas.
This model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. It also comes with six different tips. While I use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.
Other than eliminating the need to floss, the Waterpik has been beneficial to me. My teeth are always clean, I don't have gum disease, plaque, dental decay, etc.
The Waterpik is easy to use and maintain and has  paid for itself many times over since I never buy floss.",A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,4.648648648648648,5.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"I received this as a gift and just love it.  Make it your mouth, teeth and gums' best friend.  I had a much smaller water pick and although quite inexpensive, was decent enough.  It was a Yugo compared to this Lexus of water flossers!

First, read the instructions.  Start off with low pressure as this little pump can shoot out quite an aquatic projectile!  Just make sure you have the nozzle turned AWAY from your eyes.  NEVER let this anywhere near your eyes.  Once you have regulated the flow to where you want it, you are ready to enter a whole new world of oral health!

This little Godsend also comes with a tongue cleaner.  After you give yourself a good oral cleansing, you and your dentist will have entered into a new phase of your oral health partnership.  This is EXCELLENT for your tongue, teeth and gums and does a very thorough job.  You reduce placque and bacteria considerably and the water jet can reach places where dental floss never reaches.",AIEEK7AHXKZCC,4.648648648648648,5.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,4.0,"My 12 year old just got braces for the first time and the procedure to floss between his teeth was never going to happen. So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...",A1EVV74UQYVKRY,4.648648648648648,4.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,4.0,"Waterpik Ultra Flosser

Having used an older model of the Waterpik, I found this new Ultra unit to be significantly quieter and easier to use. The pressure control is now on the base unit and the motor sounds quieter and smoother. With the old model, it sounded like a Sherman tank fired up and I have to close the bathroom door to avoid disturbing anyone else in the house.

The tips are different, so you have to buy replacement tips designed for WP-100 which isn't that well advertised. In my opinion, the manufacturer should have streamlined the tip design so that they used one design/variety and interchange it among models like Oral B does with its electric toothbrushes. The Oral B unit I bought in the mid 1990s uses the same brushes as the new Oral B 5000 I purchased earlier this year.

The spare tips for the Waterpik Ultra are stored in a lid that clips to the reservoir which I think is a faulty idea. I almost broke the lid trying to remove it to fill up the reservoir, and I had no place to put it in the meantime. I almost broke it twice so I just kept it in the box. Waterpik should have kept the tip holder in the base unit to make it convenient for the user.

I normally just use line floss and my hygienist and dentist both agree that my gums look fine, but I use the Waterpik just for extra cleaning.

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"While this Waterpik is not a total alternative for traditional flossing, it sure does help a ton if you have braces! It saves sooo much time and effort. Honestly, if I use this and then use regular floss string afterward, I never have anything come out on the string. I love this Waterpik! My teeth feel so clean after using it.

It is easy to use. You just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. It is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! I use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. The different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. It flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. The coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.

I use a basin full of water, then refill with half water/half mouthwash and my mouth and teeth feel so clean and so smooth. It feels like I just left the dentist. It is also easy to clean from behind the teeth as well.

This is definitely one of the best investments I have made. I definitely recommend this wether you have braces or not. My kids even like using it. I bought extra heads for it so they each have their own and can just pop it on when they use the Waterpik.",A1QBOC76MIOJYP,4.648648648648648,5.0,4.0

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"I wanted to hold of a while on this review because I know there are several complaints in prior reviews so I wanted to be able to address them.

I think the biggest complaint is that you're going to get wet using this Waterpik.  I think that this complaint is very much overblown.  If you are very concerned about any water getting on the sink it is possible to use the Jet with your lips closed and then press the temporary stop button and release the water from your mouth and then start again with your lips closed.  Personally I think this is silly and I don't mind a small amount of water getting on the sink.  Could Waterpik bend the tip in such a way so that no water would run down on your hand?  Maybe but I think that would also make the unit really awkward to use.

Another complaint is that the Waterpik is not powerful enough.  I'm up to level 6 out of 10 and it has taken me about 3 months to get there.  Even though I now have a lot of experience using the Waterpik there are still times I ""miss"" and hit a soft spot in my mouth and it hurts--even at level 6.  In short, the Waterpik is extremely powerful, IMO, and I've been stuck on level 6 for over 2 weeks (I may not go any higher).  When I turn it up to level 10 and point the stream at the bathtub it is scary strong.  My advice is to start at level 1 and work up very slowly.

I had seen it mentioned that it is too easy to pop off the tip while in use.  This has not happened to me in 3 months of use.  I DO think that the placement of the button for the tip release is unfortunate because you have to be careful not to press it while you're using the Waterpik.

Some have suggested that the reservoir is too small.  In my experience the reservoir is the perfect size for a single use.  I always find that by the time I've done my whole mouth the unit runs out of water.

I have seen suggestions that there are leaks.  I want to make a very careful note here that the way the unit is designed you have to push down firmly on the reservoir once you drop it into the unit.  There is a rubber valve that has to make good contact in order to form a seal.  It isn't necessarily obvious that you need to do this just by looking at the unit (but it is in the directions).

Finally I'd just like to add a couple of my own observations.

The ""footprint"" of this unit is very small.  I really was happy about that because I have a tiny bathroom sink and i was wondering where I would put it.

Also, a waterpick is a really important part of dental hygiene and I think everyone should consider using it.  I don't personally think it replaces flossing but it makes your flossing much more effective (I generally use the Waterpik after flossing and before brushing).

If there are any questions just leave me a comment!

Edit: Long term follow-up.  The unit still works but the temporary stop button sticks now every time I use it.  To unstick it I have to turn off the unit and then tap the handle until it unsticks.

Final follow-up 9/15/11:  The unit finally stopped working altogether.  I'm not upset about it.  I can see by my order date that this pik lasted about 2 years.  Also, I think it says something that just today I ordered the exact same model.",A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL,4.648648648648648,5.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"All of our waterjets broke around the same time, so I bought 2 of these. They both work great. This unit comes with 6 various tips. It operates very quietly, I can use this before bed and not wake up anyone else who may be sleeping.

I'm most impressed with the power. I had an Interplak before which I thought was pretty good, but it's highest setting was about the same as a 3 on this thing. I notice the one I gave my kids hovers around a 3 or 4. My son says it hurts if he turns it any higher.

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"After moving across the country we ended up with a dentist who has no sense of humor.  Our family doesn't floss much.  The dentist castigated me for this and I said, ""But I do floss!  Twice a year!"" (meaning that during both of my dental visits the hygientist flosses my teeth).  The dentist and his hygienist were not amused.

So, we got a Water Pik so that next time we go (if we haven't changed dentists by then!) we will be able to tell them we do use it.  It works fine, no problems yet, but I do strongly recommend you put WARM water in it before use.  I tried to cut corners once and use the cold water that was still in it from the morning, and it was like cold needles shooting into my gums!",A2SH7OWE8QJYNC,4.648648648648648,5.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"I've always prided myself on my good teeth. I thought that flossing and brushing was enough...that was until I went to the dentist, and he said I had the beginnings of periodontal disease. That scared the hell out of me.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy. My teeth are so clean, they squeak!",A2JCJJNY43QQIV,4.648648648648648,5.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,3.0,"When I was a child our family bought the first WaterPik that came onto the market. The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

Note on my star rating: For effectiveness for the job I'd rate it 5 = I Love It but for the mess I rate it a 1 = I Hate It which averages out to 3 star rating = It's okay.",A3SMR4HRFJARSC,4.648648648648648,3.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"This is an outstanding product!  I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!

To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.

I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).

The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.

Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.

The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.

In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.

Good performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.",A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,4.648648648648648,5.0,4.0

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"After extensive dental work including a seven tooth upper implant, I found flossing impracticable. My dentist suggested using this unit twice a day, and after two months it works perfectly.

It was a little tricky learning to start it in my mouth and then letting the water drizzle out without splattering, but time and habit solved everything.

Just had my three month checkup and everything was sparkling clean around both the implant and my remaining teeth.

One small amusement: the carrying case has holders for four tips but the unit comes with six. Luckily the fifth wheel, as it were, fits in the carrying case even though there is no slot for it.

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,2.0,"I have been using this after meals since I have braces. It helps remove all the food that gets stuck around the brackets. Other than that, I don't think it is that great. The orthodontist said the priority should be flossing and brushing, not the Waterpik. He said the Waterpik does not have enough pressure to remove plaque. This is really just for getting the big chunks of food before I brush and floss with Oral-B Superfloss.
Before I got braces, I occasionally used the Waterpik but I can't say it did much for me.
It has been a year and I have noticed a puddle of water around the Waterpik after I turn it off. I think the handle is now leaking.
After my braces come off I will probably throw the Waterpik away.

UPDATE: I was right. The handle does in fact leak. I could buy a replacement handle for $10 but I don't want to. Overall, the Waterpik lasted about a year, which is not acceptable for a $50 item.",A3M3CQS3287AEO,4.648648648648648,2.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"I bought this based largely on the features and the reviews on Amazon. The hand held WP-450 model has a 2-year warranty, but I've never had the batteries last for two years. Some don't make it to 18 months. The one I bought a year ago now only lasts for about 4 or 5 sessions before the charge dies. I recharge them for over 24 yours when they get week, which is what Waterpik recommends. So I have two so I can use one while the other one charges. Got tired of all this and got this plug in model and I wish I had done this several years ago. Being tethered to the hose is not a problem at all, the hand unit is much lighter and more maneuverable than the battery model, lighter too. I use this on #7 setting on the dial and it is just about the same as my old 450 units with a fresh charge. The highest setting is really powerful! Control easy to use, uses the same tips as my old units. I floss first, lightly brush with a tooth brush, then use a Sonicare. After this routing my hygienist still found food under my gums during a routing cleaning! That is when I added the Waterpik to my routine and they never found food after that again. Amazing to see what flossing and brushing with a Sonicare leaves behind. I am 67 and my gums have receded, so I need the extra flushing power of a water flosser. Dental floss does not get down between the gum and base of the tooth. I recommend this for anyone who is either starting out with your first water flosser or using a rechargable unit that you don't want to replace every 18 months because the battery is failing. Extra tips store in the lid to the tank. Tank easy to remove for cleaning. Can even be washed in the dishwasher if you remove the rubber valve/plug unit. I love the design, tube coils up and stores in the side of the unit with the handle slipping in a holder, all tucked out of the way.

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"For me, I have been using a cordless (non Waterpik brand) and while it has helped my gums, I wanted to step my gum treatment up a few notches so I purchased this Waterpik. It is TOTALLY AMAZING how well my gums are responding to this treatment. Here is a list below of the MANY PROS of this unit:

+ Effectiveness with my gums, teeth and mouth: After using this just a short time, my gums are getting more of that lighter pink and healthy look I need for my gum health. And they feel so clean after each use. In addition, my teeth even look cleaner! Love the fact that this has 10 different intensity levels. The one  five are very, very gentle on gums (great if you have tender or swollen gums or if you are new to Waterpik). However, I am up to power 8 on this and will be up to a 10 soon) and this intensity works wonderfully on my gums. They actually enjoy their beauty treatment so to speak.

+ Pause Button on the handle  This saves the day for me as when I want to pause, the button is at my fingertips and this helps me not to spray water all around my bathroom.

+ Ease of filling and cleaning - This unit is easy to fill, clean and empty and I like the fact that it is stationery in my bathroom and does not take much counter space.

+ Attachments and what is included  This comes with 6 attachments: Classic Jet Tip, Toothbrush Tip, Tongue Cleaner, Pik Pocket Tip (my favorite attachment as it is really helping my gums), Plaque Seeker Tip, and Orthodontic Tip.
In addition to the attachments, there is a Quick Start sheet to show you how to setup the Waterpik and also there is a small owners manual that has much information on how to use each attachment and how to overall use the Waterpik with pictures and step by steps.

+ Quality and Sound: This unit is almost whisper quiet as the motor is very smooth yet heavy duty at the same time. This is a very superbly made Waterpik!

Loud, sounds like Barbie handling a concrete drill.
Constantly sprays. The spraying, doesn't stop unless you press the blue button. To me, that's backwards. It should turn on when I press the handle button, but the real on button is on the side. However, you get used to it quick after you sprayed water everywhere a few times :D.
Can't replace flossing (unfortunately you'd need a sandblaster to replace string flossing, and that would be painful.)
Your mouth will fill with water quickly, so you have to spit multiple times (really not a big deal but took time to get used to.)

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,4.0,Despite the off switch making it so much nicer than the original ones over 20 years ago...but I still manage to spray myself and the walls. I found that it didn't want to start working..or pumping actually when I attemped to prime it so to speak as the directions tell you. I set it up for that and after many minutes nothing happening. HUH...I was aware others wrote in that it was dead on arrival. But I could hear the pump being actively trying to work...just no water. So I ever so slightly lifted the corner the pump hole is on the water canister facing the pik it's on your left side towards the front corner...anyway I lifted it just a real tiny amount like maybe less than 1/4 inch or even no more than an 1/8 even. And a couple bubbles came up and I set it back down seating it again and the water came through right after that. So it was an air lock. That simple and that simple a fix but sometimes an airlock might be larger than the few small bubbles I had emerge. So you might have to work it a bit  maybe even shake it back and forth gentle of course. This kind of information might be helpful and prevent returns in the future.

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"When i was 16 my dentist told me to buy a Waterpik as an alternative to flossing which I didn't like then or now. Many years have past and I have shot through quite a few Waterpik models and this is the current one I own. It is a little more evolved than its predecessors, but it still performs in pretty much the same way it always has. You fill the reservoir with water, attach the head to the handle which has a control to turn the water stream on and off, and then turn the device on to produce a spray of water as you move the head around to remove debris from between your teeth and gums. I think of the Waterpik as a power washer for the teeth and gums because it forces out pressurized water to irrigate those areas.
This model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. It also comes with six different tips. While I use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.
Other than eliminating the need to floss, the Waterpik has been beneficial to me. My teeth are always clean, I don't have gum disease, plaque, dental decay, etc.

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"I received this as a gift and just love it.  Make it your mouth, teeth and gums' best friend.  I had a much smaller water pick and although quite inexpensive, was decent enough.  It was a Yugo compared to this Lexus of water flossers!

First, read the instructions.  Start off with low pressure as this little pump can shoot out quite an aquatic projectile!  Just make sure you have the nozzle turned AWAY from your eyes.  NEVER let this anywhere near your eyes.  Once you have regulated the flow to where you want it, you are ready to enter a whole new world of oral health!

This little Godsend also comes with a tongue cleaner.  After you give yourself a good oral cleansing, you and your dentist will have entered into a new phase of your oral health partnership.  This is EXCELLENT for your tongue, teeth and gums and does a very thorough job.

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,4.0,"My 12 year old just got braces for the first time and the procedure to floss between his teeth was never going to happen. So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...",A1EVV74UQYVKRY,4.648648648648648,4.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,4.0,"Waterpik Ultra Flosser

Having used an older model of the Waterpik, I found this new Ultra unit to be significantly quieter and easier to use. The pressure control is now on the base unit and the motor sounds quieter and smoother. With the old model, it sounded like a Sherman tank fired up and I have to close the bathroom door to avoid disturbing anyone else in the house.

The tips are different, so you have to buy replacement tips designed for WP-100 which isn't that well advertised. In my opinion, the manufacturer should have streamlined the tip design so that they used one design/variety and interchange it among models like Oral B does with its electric toothbrushes. The Oral B unit I bought in the mid 1990s uses the same brushes as the new Oral B 5000 I purchased earlier this year.

The spare tips for the Waterpik Ultra are stored in a lid that clips to the reservoir which I think is a faulty idea. I almost broke the lid trying to remove it to fill up the reservoir, and I had no place to put it in the meantime. I almost broke it twice so I just kept it in the box. Waterpik should have kept the tip holder in the base unit to make it convenient for the user.

I normally just use line floss and my hygienist and dentist both agree that my gums look fine, but I use the Waterpik just for extra cleaning.

Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"While this Waterpik is not a total alternative for traditional flossing, it sure does help a ton if you have braces! It saves sooo much time and effort. Honestly, if I use this and then use regular floss string afterward, I never have anything come out on the string. I love this Waterpik! My teeth feel so clean after using it.

It is easy to use. You just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. It is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! I use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. The different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. It flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. The coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.

I use a basin full of water, then refill with half water/half mouthwash and my mouth and teeth feel so clean and so smooth. It feels like I just left the dentist. It is also easy to clean from behind the teeth as well.

This is definitely one of the best investments I have made. I definitely recommend this wether you have braces or not. My kids even like using it. I bought extra heads for it so they each have their own and can just pop it on when they use the Waterpik.",A1QBOC76MIOJYP,4.648648648648648,5.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"I love this unit.  I still haven't worked my way up to the strongest flow, but my teeth feel totally clean and my gums look healthy.  It's an additon to brushing and flossing I wish I had started long ago.  Don't hesitate to buy one of these units.",A3LKLXDSW1IZSV,4.648648648648648,5.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"I wanted to hold of a while on this review because I know there are several complaints in prior reviews so I wanted to be able to address them.

I think the biggest complaint is that you're going to get wet using this Waterpik.  I think that this complaint is very much overblown.  If you are very concerned about any water getting on the sink it is possible to use the Jet with your lips closed and then press the temporary stop button and release the water from your mouth and then start again with your lips closed.  Personally I think this is silly and I don't mind a small amount of water getting on the sink.  Could Waterpik bend the tip in such a way so that no water would run down on your hand?  Maybe but I think that would also make the unit really awkward to use.

Another complaint is that the Waterpik is not powerful enough.  I'm up to level 6 out of 10 and it has taken me about 3 months to get there.  Even though I now have a lot of experience using the Waterpik there are still times I ""miss"" and hit a soft spot in my mouth and it hurts--even at level 6.  In short, the Waterpik is extremely powerful, IMO, and I've been stuck on level 6 for over 2 weeks (I may not go any higher).  When I turn it up to level 10 and point the stream at the bathtub it is scary strong.  My advice is to start at level 1 and work up very slowly.

I had seen it mentioned that it is too easy to pop off the tip while in use.  This has not happened to me in 3 months of use.  I DO think that the placement of the button for the tip release is unfortunate because you have to be careful not to press it while you're using the Waterpik.

Some have suggested that the reservoir is too small.  In my experience the reservoir is the perfect size for a single use.  I always find that by the time I've done my whole mouth the unit runs out of water.

I have seen suggestions that there are leaks.  I want to make a very careful note here that the way the unit is designed you have to push down firmly on the reservoir once you drop it into the unit.  There is a rubber valve that has to make good contact in order to form a seal.  It isn't necessarily obvious that you need to do this just by looking at the unit (but it is in the directions).

Finally I'd just like to add a couple of my own observations.

The ""footprint"" of this unit is very small.  I really was happy about that because I have a tiny bathroom sink and i was wondering where I would put it.

Also, a waterpick is a really important part of dental hygiene and I think everyone should consider using it.  I don't personally think it replaces flossing but it makes your flossing much more effective (I generally use the Waterpik after flossing and before brushing).

If there are any questions just leave me a comment!

Edit: Long term follow-up.  The unit still works but the temporary stop button sticks now every time I use it.  To unstick it I have to turn off the unit and then tap the handle until it unsticks.

Final follow-up 9/15/11:  The unit finally stopped working altogether.  I'm not upset about it.  I can see by my order date that this pik lasted about 2 years.  Also, I think it says something that just today I ordered the exact same model.",A2SRVDDDOQ8QJL,4.648648648648648,5.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"All of our waterjets broke around the same time, so I bought 2 of these. They both work great. This unit comes with 6 various tips. It operates very quietly, I can use this before bed and not wake up anyone else who may be sleeping.

I'm most impressed with the power. I had an Interplak before which I thought was pretty good, but it's highest setting was about the same as a 3 on this thing. I notice the one I gave my kids hovers around a 3 or 4. My son says it hurts if he turns it any higher.

This is a great little unit, quiet, lots of tips, and keeps teeth extremely clean. Highly reccommended!",A2X3L31KCXBHCL,4.648648648648648,5.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"After moving across the country we ended up with a dentist who has no sense of humor.  Our family doesn't floss much.  The dentist castigated me for this and I said, ""But I do floss!  Twice a year!"" (meaning that during both of my dental visits the hygientist flosses my teeth).  The dentist and his hygienist were not amused.

So, we got a Water Pik so that next time we go (if we haven't changed dentists by then!) we will be able to tell them we do use it.  It works fine, no problems yet, but I do strongly recommend you put WARM water in it before use.  I tried to cut corners once and use the cold water that was still in it from the morning, and it was like cold needles shooting into my gums!",A2SH7OWE8QJYNC,4.648648648648648,5.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"I've always prided myself on my good teeth. I thought that flossing and brushing was enough...that was until I went to the dentist, and he said I had the beginnings of periodontal disease. That scared the hell out of me.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy. My teeth are so clean, they squeak!",A2JCJJNY43QQIV,4.648648648648648,5.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,3.0,"When I was a child our family bought the first WaterPik that came onto the market. The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

Note on my star rating: For effectiveness for the job I'd rate it 5 = I Love It but for the mess I rate it a 1 = I Hate It which averages out to 3 star rating = It's okay.",A3SMR4HRFJARSC,4.648648648648648,3.0,4.0
Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser,5.0,"This is an outstanding product!  I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!

To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.

I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).

The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.

Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.

The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.

In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.

Good performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.",A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,4.648648648648648,5.0,4.0

Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men's Shaver,5.0,"Unlike some previous reviewers comparing the two shavers, I haven't experienced hair-pulling or face-cutting problems with the Norelco, but the machine's quiet, unlabored operation frequently caused me to wonder if it was even running. More importantly, it made shaving around a beard too much of a ""guessing game.""  Especially if you try to maintain a consistent, even line between beard and skin at the neck, the Norelco leads to frustration--the line is constantly moving lower while becoming increasingly irregular.

Put simply, this Remington is the one to get if your face is of a hirsute nature. (Braun once won my allegiance--until I added up the cost of continually replacing those delicate, ripped foils).  The Remington MS2-390 is not only quite rugged but ergonomic, inexpensive, and darned effective.  As for the ""noise"" that many complain about, I've come to regard it as an all-business wake-up call, a high-pitched buzz of excitement confirming that the day's first task is under way--not to mention well in hand.

To extend the metaphor, the Norelco is a cumbersome, bloated bomber from the German Luftewaffe whereas the Remington is a British RAF Spitfire which, in the hands of a skilled pilot, can fly circles around any of the balky Teutonic Titans.  Or, if you prefer, the Norelco is the feminine passive Grail; the Remington the male active Lance. Norelco purrs; Remington rocks.",A6FIAB28IS79,5.0,5.0,4.0

SK-II Facial Treatment Essence,3.0,"My expectations for any anti-aging product are pretty modest.  I think that certain products can make your skin tone appear more even resulting in a brighter complexion, and skin that reflects light prettily tends to appear more youthful.  I do not think that there are any miracle creams out there that are going to make you look decades younger, and I find most of the hype surrounding many anti-aging products is just that - hype, with no science to back it up.  That being said...

SK-II is a well-known, high-end skin care line and I was excited to give it a try.  This product arrived without any instructions, which I find odd.  Does it replace your toner or do you use it after your toner?  I had to go online to the company's website to do a little research.  You apply this product to clean skin.  You can use a cotton pad or pat it into the skin with your hands.  It absorbs into my skin quickly and completely; there's no sticky feeling nor is it oily.  It has the consistency of water and a very slight (and not unpleasant) odor.  I experience no stinging, redness, irritation or breakouts.  This does leave my skin feeling a little tight, and I follow up with my usual daytime moisturizer and nighttime retinol cream.

After nearly four weeks of use (twice daily) I have to say that I've noticed absolutely no change in my skin whatsoever.  Now I'm pretty happy with my current skin care regimen, and it's entirely possible that what I'm using is effective and I'm not going to see any major changes by adding another product into the mix.

Bottom line:  Pleasant and easy to use; no unwanted side effects but also no noticeable improvement.

Would I recommend this product?  Hard to say.  Everyone's skin is different and I've read online testimonials by women who swear by this stuff.  Since it didn't do anything for me, I can't be too enthusiastic about it, and frankly I find the price a bit prohibitive.",A1XCSAX4BRT89Y,3.3333333333333335,3.0,4.0

Caswell-Massey - Newport Soap on a Rope,5.0,"For me, I recently bought these at a local store near my home and have been so impressed with the mini brushes. I keep a couple in my purse to use after I eat a meal out or on a place with no water for regular brushing.

+ The Brush Part - The center with the freshener is also like a tiny bit of toothpaste/mouthwash as my teeth,gums and overall mouth feel very clean after I use this. Still I REGULAR BRUSH and floss at least 2 - 3 times per day.

+ The Pick Part - Yes, the pick is a hard plastic, yet it is very thin and works just like a toothpick, yet better than a toothpick because there is no wood to break (I have broken so many toothpicks, so this is so so much better).

+ Other Uses I Have Found - Twice a day, I use PLAX Rinse before brushing and then begin my regular brushing with this tiny brush as it has firm enough bristles to flake off the Plaque and even some tartar. (The PLAX Rinse takes at least 2 weeks to really see hard tartar coming off by the way - yet this firm brush seems to help the process for me).

Highly recommend this to all!",ABDR6IJ93HFIO,5.0,5.0,4.0

Liquid Trust,5.0,"I have used Liquid Trust for over ten years or at least as long as I became aware of their existence.  I remember you could buy two of the one ounce for around $100 and receive another free.  Of course I didn't buy that deal the first time.  I just bought one bottle and I have my own business and had plenty of opportunity to try it out to see if it would increase trust in clients and my own office staff.
I was not in a hurry to make a snap judgment, however I found that it did not attract men or women sexually, but it did increase trust a great deal.
Most of the clients already knew me and this gave a distinctive increase in the trust level and I could feel that trust.  Most wanted to stay around a little longer and visit more and open up more about conversations about any subject.  A woman will not be interested in a man unless she trusts him.  I am married so I was not interested in attracting women for a sexual reason however I did find that many more women were friendly and very open, even on a first time meeting.  Any normal man will like that interaction even if he isn't just out to get anything and everything from women, which incidentally is not very moral in my book.  To each his own though.  We all answer for our mistakes so user beware in some cases.
Trust is the first and most important first impression no matter whether the relationship is business or personal.  I found men to be much more interested in visiting and maybe a fishing trip or whatever  --- basketball  --- hike ---  canoeing.  Sports minded men always need to find other men who share in sports minded activities.  Trust is just as important in those type clean relations.  I have to say Liquid Trust is an incredible tool in most cases if used with good intentions.  It's easier to trust someone who isn't always looking at a woman's crotch or breasts.
No, I don't work for the company and I am surprised that some others have found the Liquid Trust to be useless.  I suspect, if they are long haired yippie bippies who haven't showered in two weeks, it might just be difficult to get any woman to trust them especially if the body odor is much stronger than the Liquid Trust.",A3TA8JVTYTXHKA,5.0,5.0,4.0

Gillette Venus ComfortGlide Freesia Women's Razor - 1 handle + 2 refills,1.0,"This razor does provide a smooth shave, that's all the good I can say about it. I have stubble a few hours later like always, so it doesn't help reduce shaving. I cut my ankles with this razor around 4 times because the head is so big and bulky and I missed a million spots on my knees but it shaved the main part of my leg fine. I hate the gel bars on this razor, they get gooey and stringy and the goop gets on the blades and makes it hard to shave. I would NOT buy this razor again. Also I have very pale, sensitive skin, and my skin did not break out in a rash or get bumps like other people have reported.

EDIT: Do not attempt to shave your lady bits with this razor. It SUCKS! It can't even cut the hair right! It took like 30 minutes to shave down there when it takes like 10 with a normal razor. The stupid gel bars are in the way and the razors don't want to get close to the skin. Not to mention the hairs get trapped in there. GROSS!",A2XNJJ9TF70P4J,1.0,1.0,4.0

"Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Rinse, Cool Wintergreen, 33.8 Fluid Ounce",2.0,"While I like non-alcohol-based rinses, I was not pleased with this. On the plus side, it provides the same benefits as other rinses and does it without the burning sensation I get from those with alcohol. Plus, the lack of alcohol helps me deal with chronic dry mouth issues (alcohol rinses and mouthwashes make dry mouth much worse).

But how a rinse tastes is important since you'll be tasting it for some time after use. This was overly sweet rather than ""fresh mint"" tasting like other rinses (such as ACT). The aftertaste remained sweet to the point where it was unpleasant.

I'm was concerned about the potential for tooth staining. I've not had any issues with that so far with this rinse, but it was a concern.

"Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Rinse, Cool Wintergreen, 33.8 Fluid Ounce",4.0,"From what I can tell, this is the non-alcoholic version of Crest's ""Invigorating Clean Mint"" mouthwash.  Instead of the alcohol, which is a natural (and tasty) preservative, you get parabens.  The user should be aware of this, as some people claim they cause cancer (I'm too uninformed about that topic to state an opinion, but some people might wish to look into it).

Amazingly, this actually tastes very good, whereas every non-alcoholic mouthwash I've ever had before (mostly in hotels) has been horrible.  The ironic thing is that it says they don't use alcohol so that you don't get that burn.  Despite the fact that the burn is what makes me feel like it's doing its job, there is more burn in this than the version with the alcohol!  Admittedly, that burn is slightly different.

"Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Rinse, Cool Wintergreen, 33.8 Fluid Ounce",4.0,"The mouthwash burn sensation in the Crest Pro-Health mouthwashes is stronger than in some of the other Crest formulas, but is similar to the Scope mouthwash burn. I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to the mouthwash burn, so the strength of it is usually the first thing I notice when trying out a new mouthwash. My husband who seems immune to the strength of every mouthwash out there, seems fine with this Crest formula and has no problem washing with it. I haven't had any issues with this mouthwash turning my teeth colors or causing any kind of build, and neither has my mouthwash addicted husband. So it seems to work well. It leaves your breath smelling great and lasts quite a while. I like this wintergreen version a bit more than the mint, since I've always been a fan of the more refreshing taste of wintergreen.

One thing I do appreciate is that Crest did not use Yellow #5 food coloring to make this mouthwash, since most companies use that color to produce the green hue in their products (including Scope). Some people, myself included, have a sever food allergy to Yellow #5 and can't use or eat anything with that food coloring it it. For those with this condition, note that Crest has used Yellow #6 instead to create the mouthwashes green color. The Crest Pro-Heath mouth wash in the Invigorating Clean version, which is an even greener colored mouthwash, also doesn't use Yellow #5, and used #6. So anyone with this food coloring sensitivity who wants to try these out, can do so knowing these won't have Yellow #5 in them.",A1F7YU6O5RU432,3.75,4.0,4.0

"Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Rinse, Cool Wintergreen, 33.8 Fluid Ounce",4.0,"I'm not a big fan of alcohol in mouthwash, so I was grateful to realize that this particular one was alcohol free. Why is that important? Because alcohol can be absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth. Being friends with people taking Antabuse, I know they are cautioned about using mouthwash for that very reason.

Because of that, this is safe for kids as well as adults.

The flavor - I am much more used to a milder flavor with wintergreen. This has a very strong, almost biting flavor. But it does leave me with a clean feeling in my mouth. At the time I tested this, I had a severe ear infection and was unable to open my mouth except for the tiniest amount. Because of this, brushing my teeth resulted in extreme pain, and I was worried about whether I had done a decent job - so having this to (hopefully) do what it says was a great relief.

"Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Rinse, Cool Wintergreen, 33.8 Fluid Ounce",3.0,"I thought this rinse might be a more palatable alternative to Listerine Total Care.  But with average performance and a questionable active ingredient, it is unlikely that I will use this again.

The rinse comes in an easy to used bottle with a pleasing contour. I did not particuarly care for the wintergreen flavor, it was rather sweet, mint-like and artificial. But my major concern come from the potential side effects for the active ingredient, cetylpridinium chloride. While it has antiseptic, anesthetic and disinfectant properties it is used in bug poisons as well as dental preparations. While its use has been FDA approved, I think there are more natural, less toxic and equally effective ingredients available. Moreover this ingredient has been known to cause browning of the teeth as well as intefering with the sense of taste. The bottle label warns of the discoloration risk but claims that the staining is neither permanent nor harmful. It claims such stains may be removed by brushing or ""at your next dental visit"". If my teeth suddenly browned, I don't think I would want to wait for my next regularly scheduled dental visit. Dental visits don't rate high on my fun things to do list and I would rather not spend my discretionary income on removing tooth discoloration caused by a mouth wash.

"Crest Whitestrips, Daily Multicare, 84 strips",5.0,"Crest Whitestrips-Daily Multicare Formula is designed for ""maintenance"" bleaching, to maintain the whiteness of your teeth once the desired shade has been reached.  Therefore, one should use a Crest Strip product such as the entry-level system&nbsp;Classic Whitestrips-Crest Dental Whitening System, 56 Strips, or a stronger product like&nbsp;Crest Whitestrips Premium- 7- Day Dental Whitening Formula System, 28 Strips, before the Daily Multicare Formula is used.

This product is used for just 5 minutes a day to maintain the whiteness of bleached teeth. (All the other Crest Whitestrip products advise a 30-minute treatment once or twice a day protocol). Since there are 84 strips (42 upper/42 lower), this enough for a full 6 weeks of daily bleaching.
There are virtually no side-effects, such as sensitive teeth, or ""burned"" gums, as the contact time is just 5 minutes. This system has a 6% hydrogen peroxide gel, the same as Crest Classic Whitestrips.

An alternative to this product of daily bleaching maintenance is to use one of the original systems again, such as Classic Whitestrips for 1-2  weeks to restore the bleach white color of the teeth.

Crest White Strips come in as many as 7 different formulations, which can be quite confusing to the consumer.  Please remember the key difference in all these products is the strength of the hydrogen peroxide gel, and of course the price. The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the faster the bleaching result, and the most costly as well.  Here is a quick summary of the products:

1. Crest White Strips Classic.  This is Crest's first bleaching product, introduced in 2001.  It has a 6% hydrogen peroxide gel, and is applied twice a day for 30 minutes for 14-days of treatment.  It is still a very popular product, and perhaps offers the lowest number of side-effects.

2. Crest White Strips Premium came out in 2004.  It is a 10% hydrogen peroxide gel, applied twice a day for 30 minutes each session, for 7-days of treatment. The 10% hydrogen peroxide strength offers a quicker bleaching result, but perhaps with more tooth and gum sensitivity.

3.  Crest Pro Effects came out in 2008. It is another 10% hydrogen peroxide gel, but offers a 10-day treatment protocol - again, twice a day for 30 minutes each time.

4. Crest Advanced Seal is the latest product (February, 2009), and it also has a 10% hydrogen peroxide, twice a day, 30-minutes a day, 10-day treatment. The main advantage to this system is that the strip is more adherent to the teeth, and the user can talk, exercise, drive, be active, even drink fluids, with the strip in place.  The other systems advise the user to be stationary for the 30-minute treatment time.

5. Daily Whitening with Tartar Protection is another 6% hydrogen peroxide gel strip. It is used just 5-minutes/day, and has an added chemical that discourages tartar from attaching to the teeth.  It has 38 upper and lower strips in the package.  Some people form tartar very easily, especially on the backs of the lower teeth, and this product inhibits the tartar from attaching to the teeth.

In using any of the Crest bleaching products, please follow the specified instructions that come with each product.

Crest White Strip products work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains. If you have severely stained teeth, especially those with tetracycline (an antibiotic) stain, the strips may not work well for you.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated in-office form of bleaching (called ""power bleaching"").

Philips Norelco arcitec 1060 Men's Shaving System,3.0,"I have used Norelco shavers for many years and prefer them to all other models I have tried. This review comes from much experience with the brand.

This Arcitec design looks fancy and works well, but gets three average stars because it really works no better than the previous non-space-age, less expensive designs. The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don't waste money on the Cleaner accessory. It is fairly comfortable to hold (I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job. It requires cleaning after each use as there is no space for the hairs. I have always cleaned my shavers after each use anyway. Unless you just want the apperance, it is not worth the extra money.

Technically: The triple-blade per round head (each cutter has three spinning blade areas) does not do any better than a double cutting blade. Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit in the 70's, Jim Belushi said, ""Buy a triple bladed razor. For those that will believe anything"". Lift-and-cut is a ridiculous concept and a marketing ploy, but Norelco's do a nice job. Norelco went back to more diagonal openings with this model, which is good. Many other newer models have lots of little pin-holes which are worthless, as the hairs have no time to enter a small hole with shaving motion. You would have to set it directly on a hair to cut it. The less pin-holes the better.

Feel: The head design feels better on the neck, and has not caused razor-burn if I do not stretch the skin tight like I need to with the original model. It takes the same time to shave as my older unit, and I get no better results, no faster. It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.

Function: It is a little bit easier to shave under the nose, above my mustache, but not a major difference. It is much harder to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped. Very poorly designed trimmer, so I use my older shaver for that.

Battery: Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices. But, it states to not over-charge. Meaning, you need to be around when recharging to unplug it after it is charged; not good for those that shave and must go to work. The other units would shut off after charging.

Cleaner/Charger: Again, one needs to be around when it is finished to not over-charge. The cleaner is not necessary and a waste of time, money, and chemicals. I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket (one can't blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can't be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).

Overall: Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns. Nicer on the neck.

I would return it, BUT, it was a gift, AND I like the look of it. I know, I know!!

Philips Norelco arcitec 1060 Men's Shaving System,4.0,"The Shave:
This is a lower-cost version of the Norelco 1090.  The major diffference is the display. The floating heads on the Norelco electric shaver really do a good job of conforming to the curves of my face. It takes me about five minutes to shave. The shave is much more uniform than that of the Braun 3615 that I have been using for the past few years. However, the shave is not as close. Before the Braun, I used a Norelco 5801. This model is a big improvement over the old Norelco which was slow and not very close at all. The trade-off with respect to the Braun is one of a closer shave using the Braun vs. a more uniform shave with the new Norelco.

Maintenance:
The clippings are collected in pockets under the shaving heads, This is an advantage in that the clippings are not scattered over the bathroom sink as they are with some electric razors. The pockets have to be cleaned out every shave or two. This is not a big problem. It only takes a few seconds. The manual indicates that the RQ10 shaving head assembly must be replaced every year. Amazon offers the RQ10 for $35. By contrast the Braun cutter and foil assembly which lasts for about one year sells on Amazon for around $24.

PS: I found that I had to replace the head assembly after 6 months. I am now using a Remington Flex 360 Rotary Shaver which has a design similiar to the Norelco but provides a faster, closer shave, and costs a lot less.",A3FKGKUCI3DG9U,3.5,4.0,4.0
Philips Norelco 1050CC arcitec Men's Shaving System,2.0,"::I own the standard 1050 Arcitc razor without the cleaning contraption (CC), so my review is solely for that portion of the product::

I was drawn in by the sleek modern looks of this razor. I'm always used Philips Norelco rotaries in the past and have been very happy with them. My last razor was a&nbsp;Philips Norelco SpeedXL&nbsp;and I'd still be using it today if I had not worn out 2 of the blades after 4 years of heavy use. In fact, I keep it around to help get the stray hairs the Arcitec misses.

If your stubble is medium to heavy thickness, then this razor will annoy the heck out of you. What used to take me about 2 minutes now takes more than 5. It just doesn't want to cut ...and if you have more than 2 days' growth, you are really in for a problem. It takes multiple passes with me stretching my skin to try to get the hairs up for this razor to get at them, and even then it misses some. It is less than 6 months old and it's as if the blades have gotten dull. But they don't pull at the hairs so that is not it. It took 2 years for my last razor's blades to dull. This one just refuses to cut well. I clean and charge it religiously, so that isn't the issue either. To top it off, the small extendable straight razor is all but useless because the main shaving head gets in the way.

This is a good looking razor that holds a charge for a long time, but that is where the pros end. I wish I could return it but I waited too long. I'll be going back to the bulkier (but quieter) XL style after this one, or maybe even convert to a Braun. You let me down with this product Philips.",A2W9I628I6SE1U,2.75,2.0,4.0

Philips Norelco 1050CC arcitec Men's Shaving System,3.0,"I have used Norelco shavers for many years and prefer them to all other models I have tried. This review comes from much experience with the brand.

This Arcitec design looks fancy and works well, but gets three average stars because it really works no better than the previous non-space-age, less expensive designs. The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don't waste money on the Cleaner accessory. It is fairly comfortable to hold (I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job. It requires cleaning after each use as there is no space for the hairs. I have always cleaned my shavers after each use anyway. Unless you just want the apperance, it is not worth the extra money.

Technically: The triple-blade per round head (each cutter has three spinning blade areas) does not do any better than a double cutting blade. Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit in the 70's, Jim Belushi said, ""Buy a triple bladed razor. For those that will believe anything"". Lift-and-cut is a ridiculous concept and a marketing ploy, but Norelco's do a nice job. Norelco went back to more diagonal openings with this model, which is good. Many other newer models have lots of little pin-holes which are worthless, as the hairs have no time to enter a small hole with shaving motion. You would have to set it directly on a hair to cut it. The less pin-holes the better.

Feel: The head design feels better on the neck, and has not caused razor-burn if I do not stretch the skin tight like I need to with the original model. It takes the same time to shave as my older unit, and I get no better results, no faster. It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.

Function: It is a little bit easier to shave under the nose, above my mustache, but not a major difference. It is much harder to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped. Very poorly designed trimmer, so I use my older shaver for that.

Battery: Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices. But, it states to not over-charge. Meaning, you need to be around when recharging to unplug it after it is charged; not good for those that shave and must go to work. The other units would shut off after charging.

Cleaner/Charger: Again, one needs to be around when it is finished to not over-charge. The cleaner is not necessary and a waste of time, money, and chemicals. I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket (one can't blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can't be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).

Overall: Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns. Nicer on the neck.

I would return it, BUT, it was a gift, AND I like the look of it. I know, I know!!

Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men's Shaving System,2.0,"I've been using Norelco rotary shavers for the last 20+ years. I've always found them to work well and be fairly comfortable. After a few years use, instead of replacing the heads and/or battery again, I pick up the latest top of the line Norelco that's available. The Arcitec 1090 looked awesome, and I was looking forward to using it when I received it. What a disappointing product. Bottom line, it does not work nearly as well as my Quadra Action or SmartTouch XL models. I gave it some time thinking maybe my skin needed to adjust to it, but it has not improved. It just gives a mediocre, uncomfortable shave. I've since returned it, and ordered new heads for my older Norelco. I would seriously think twice before spending $200 on this product.",A2UOHALGF2X77Q,3.4285714285714284,2.0,4.0
Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men's Shaving System,3.0,"I've been on a quest for a new electric razor since Christmas. I went astray and tried a Panasonic Foil type, and I won't make that mistake again. So now I knew it was Norelco or nothing. So which one? The top of the line 1090 was just too expensive for me to justify but then the price dropped and I got Amazon Prime all on the same day! Now it was doable and I'd get it the next day? Too much to take... I had to finally get it.

The new cleaning method alone is worth the price if you are a Norelco fan. It's so quick, and no removable combs and cutters to mix-up in the sink.  Just flip 'em open and shoot a little hot water in there or run the whole head in hot soapy water. Done. Waaaay better system than any other Norelco shaver. It charges in only an hour and stays charged for a lot of shaves. 65 minutes worth. That's a lot of shaves.

Unfortunately the quality of the shave is not on par with other high-end Norelco shavers I've had in the past. It takes longer and you have to go over your face several times to get the same results and I used to get with my Norelco Spectra.

Lastly, let's talk about something that really doesn't matter. The looks. This thing is gorgeous. The pictures on this website don't do it justice. For one thing the materials it's made from are all top of the line. Carbon Fiber panels, and super rich ""Black Chrome"" accents on the front.  Surround all that with a brushed stainless steel bezel and it's about the best looking shaver ever made. It's even got that nice ""rubberized"" back so it won't get scratched up in the drawer. Of course this thing is so good looking you might just be tempted to leave it out as an ""art object"" for all to see.  It's a great looking razor that does an ""okay"" job of shaving. I'm about half way happy with it... About half way unhappy...

UPDATE: Well it's been about a month with the new shaver and as much as I like how it looks, I have to send it back to Amazon. My SpeedXL shaves much faster and closer than this new bad boy Arcitec. I really wanted to love this razor, but in the end, I buy a razor to use, not to look at.

I don't know how people can say this thing shaves better than the old ones. It absolutely does not. It sure looks damn good though...  Maybe Norelco can improve the heads on a future model and I'll give it another shot in a year or so.... For now? Stick with your old Norelcos. They do a better and faster job.",ALVES1OA7MBXP,3.4285714285714284,3.0,4.0
Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men's Shaving System,4.0,"I am reviewing this on behalf of my boyfriend who is the lucky user of this electric shaver. He still insists that razor a blade gives a closer shave and I agree, the skin is a lot smoother and clearer but this is great for the weekends when he wants to get rid of the stubble and not scratch my face off. This enables him to get a smooth feeling on the skin without stripping and irritating it, and no creams and products are needed. The 3 rotating heads really adjust to the contour of the face and they snap open for easy clean up with water. I've seen him use it and it's a cinch, fast, easy and no mess!

Overall this is a great product, it works well and the face feels and looks good afterwards and it takes very little time to use. Better than shaving when it comes to comfort but my man still prefers the razor when he has to shave for work. This makes a great holiday gift, a gadget that people wouldn't run out and buy for themselves necessarily and fun to have as an option in the morning.

Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men's Shaving System,3.0,"Aside from a couple years in college I haven't used an electric razor until I got this one.  After using the razor for three weeks to get used to it, it is still a bit of a let down.  It does very well cutting the hair along the cheeks but doesn't to very well along the chin and neck and found myself going over these areas over and over again to get the desired shave even breaking out my conventional razor occationaly to get a few pesky hairs that just wouldn't cut.

There are plenty of pros about this razor.  The trimmer does a decent job evening out the sideburns.  The razor tells you how much time the battery has left so you should never run out of juice in the middle of shave and it is easy to charge either on the stand or in the carring case the razor comes with.  The razor is really easy to clean.  And there is little to no irritation after the shave aside from a couple minutes of numbness right after the shave, but it's nothing a splash of water won't cure.

But if you want a close shave, a conventional razor is better but when I don't have time to break out the shaving cream, this razor will definately be suffciant.",A1LHAXBM5GBJS2,3.4285714285714284,3.0,4.0
Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men's Shaving System,5.0,"I used to wonder what caused redness and skin irritation every time I shaved. When it started for me I tried switching to environmentally friendly shaving cream, then I changed my shaving blades, then I tried changing my aftershave, but nothing helped. Regardless of what I did the irritation always came back.

I think I finally found the answer after I started using the new Philips Norelco drive-shave system. First, let me sing a praise for its smooth design and ingenious way of reminding me when I need to clean the blades (a cool blue image of a water faucet appears on the handle immediately after each shave) and how many minutes of battery life remain (cool blue large numbers appear after every shave as a reminder). As far as I am concerned these are the two main things I need to know so that I can get the job done.  Next, let share with you how wonderful I feel after each shave. The benefits of dry shaving prevented my skin from being exposed to the sharp blades and water, which in my opinion are solely responsible for the irritation of my skin.

If I could recommend one minor improvement, it would be to make the system's blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck. I find myself having to reapply some circulating effort around the same areas every time until I get all the hairs out of the way. Still, this is a small price to pay considering the fact that I am pain and embracement free after each shave. A great gift idea.",A28N2AWOVO2PB,3.4285714285714284,5.0,4.0

Environment:
The first thing that you notice about the Norelco razor is the packaging. The outside layer is a cardboard box that is laminated with metal foil and plastic. There is no way that this can be recycled. Inside the laminated cardboard box is a PET clear plastic enclosure. This enclosure has an outside layer and an internal division. It is thinner than most of this type of packaging so you can cut it open. The PET plastic is type 1 and may be recycled. I think that Philips could come up with a packaging scheme that is more efficient. On the other hand, having a battery minutes-remaining indicator in the razor means that you do not have to keep it plugged in all the time, so that it may drain less electricity than other rechargeable appliances do.",A3FKGKUCI3DG9U,3.4285714285714284,4.0,4.0
Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men's Shaver,2.0,"I really like the look of this shaver and I was hoping it would be as good as the commercials touted it to be. Alas, this was not the case. Sure, it gives a close shave, but I have to go over and over and over the same spot to get it. And there are still hairs on my neck that it just can't cut. I've had the 1050 for about 3 months now. Just over 3 years before I was given a&nbsp;Norelco SpeedXL&nbsp;and loved it. It cut quickly and did a good job. Unfortunately it wore out and the only one of the blades still cuts. So I got this new razor hoping that it would be even better than the XL. It does contour to the face really well, but it just doesn't cut my stubble easily. More than a day or two and it has a VERY hard time. And forget the tiny trimmer, it is just too hard to use. I go back to the one on the XL if I want to trim my sideburns or nose hairs. The 1050 holds a charge for a while and does clean fairly easily but you have to do it after every one or two shaves or it gets harder to get a good shave.

I like rotary shavers and have used them most of my adult life, but this one is a let-down, especially for the $130+ price. I would seriously consider trying a Phillips or Braun foil razor the next time around, given the reviews I've read. On a final note, the stand is a bit flimsy and tips easily, and the plug is a bit large, but those are minor considerations. If you want a good, close shave that doesn't irritate, I wouldn't make this the first on your list.

UPDATE: This razor has gone from bad to worse. It sometimes takes up to 10 minutes to finish a shave. The blades aren't dull since there is no pulling, but it just doesn't want to cut. I clean and maintain it meticulously so that is not the issue. This is a good looking razor, but that is about it. I cannot recommend it to anyone at this point.

Panasonic Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver,5.0,"I am writing this on behalf my wife.  This is her first electric shaver.  I own two Panasonic men's wet/dry shavers and I love them.  She bought this because she is a recessionista - it's expensive over time with disposable shavers.

The good: It's cordelss, recharchable, easy to clean, pivots, it's curved, it works well wet or dry, awesome with shave gel and it works well for the underarms and legs.  Obviously if you want silky smooth, a blade or wax will be much better.  The pop-up trimmer is great for stray hairs, or if you have a few days of growth.

What's so-so - using it to get silky smooth down under. If you don't like hair there, it's great for keeping the hedges in check.  If you like the bald look, it will get you there.  However, it will take time to go completely smooth versus using a razor. She says it's great for touch ups between blade shaves or waxes. For instance, she used it a lot during her pregnancy. In her case the results were better than expected, but she hopes that this will improve over time. It's probably a really good solution when you are traveling and are going to be wearing a bathing suit almost everyday - especially at the beach.  The salt water may not irritate the area that much.

What's bad: The bikini attachment is useless.  My wife didn't bother trying the attachment.  If you are looking to be smooth down under, you are better off using a trimmer (Panasonic makes one for women or Wahl for men) to cut things down to an easy length for shaving or preparation for waxing.  If you are looking to trim down there, again use a cordless trimmer.

Bottom line, it is a great shaver than cuts down on wasted money and waste with disposable razors.  Just remember it takes time for your skin to get used to an electric shaver.",A19FRW264WZTGP,5.0,5.0,4.0

Permanent Color-5R Rich Copper Brown Tints of Nature 4.4 oz Liquid,5.0,"I decided to go gray three years ago, and really loved my silver-white hair.  However, I am 58 and looking for another job and after going on several interviews, I  realized that age discrimination is a reality that I need to deal with.  First, I  started having a colorist weave in some lowlights.  Brown lowlights looked terrible with the white hair, and when she tried a darker color the next time, the lowlights came out ash gray.  It's very hard to find a colorist who knows how to do gray hair blending, by the way.  So, with more than $200 down the drain on lowlight attempts,  I decided to bite the bullet and just color it medium brown (my natural color before I went gray) myself.  After researching several organic products and reading online reviews, I decided on Tints of Nature.  I first bought the 4N Medium Brown because the Tints of Nature website says the product will lift your color one shade lighter.  But then I read more online reviews and found a u-tube clip that a woman shared where she colored her medium brown hair with T of N's medium blond color, as she had heard the color comes out darker than is expected. The result was medium brown.  So I went back to the store and bought 6N and 6TF--caramel/dark toffee blond to cancel out the ash lowlights.  I didn't have time to do the recommended gray hair treatment (my hair was fairly healthy from not dying it for 3 years) or to do a strand or patch test.  I used the shampoo and crme rinse that comes in the box, then towel dried my hair as directed.  I mixed half of both colors into the developer (and am saving the other halves and other developer) and coated my damp hair with the mixture, then ran a comb through to ensure every strand was coated and that the color was evenly distributed.  I was really afraid that the color wouldn't cover my white hair or that it would be too light, and that it wouldn't color over the ashy lowlights.  So  I waited the recommended 40 minutes before I washed it out.  To my relief, the color came out a beautiful, rich medium brown with slightly golden/reddish highlights (the 6TF)--and it fully covered my white hair.  While I hate coloring my hair and especially hate doing touch-ups, such a mess, this is a good product.  I experienced no burning or itching from the dye, nor was the smell terribly offensive, and best part, no animals are tested.  Once I get another job, though, it's back to silver.",A5BUARTDV7YGG,3.736842105263158,5.0,4.0

Ole Henriksen Ole Henriksen Black Currant Complexion Oil 1 fl 0z 30ml,5.0,"I'm going to state right off the bat this is well worth it..I add to any cream { it is truly improving my skin }..I
started mixing this at first to a nice cream at night..After a few weeks of  mixing face cream w/oil, I've started to use just oil a couple of days on face and neck , and I'm really impressed.

Update  6/9/2013 : I purchased this in March , I'm very happy I did , Love the scent..I'm pleased to say I can feel , and see the difference in my skin..I must state that I'm also using flax seed oil , but I use one oil , morning and night , then the other..I've taken care of my skin the best always , and never suffered too much acne..but for some reason blackheads around my nose crease { hung in there } were difficult to get rid of , this caused whiteheads to appear also...After more than 6-8 weeks of using this I no longer have the blackheads around nose , { a few clinking to the tip , but fading } and the whiteheads are getting smaller and disappearing...I use this both with a face cream , and by itself..Both ways work well..~!~

Will for sure be buying more , this oil lasts too , and it goes into skin, without waste..This will last me at least another 3-4 months..~!~",A2NPXTU9EH6GKR,5.0,5.0,4.0
Philips Norelco 8020X Moisturizing Shaving System,2.0,"Nice concept, just not very practical. Using it outside of the shower is uncomfortable so it's not the kind you want if you only want one. The lotion is expensive and you need a ton to avoid irritation. It still irritates my neck no matter what I do. I tried using it with other lotions and creams with no improvement.
Not a bad product, just not for my face.",A2UHXPMDDHRFC9,2.0,2.0,4.0
Norelco HS800 Lotion Refill,5.0,"I used the HS800 Nivea shaving conditioner with my Norelco 8040X with great results. For one thing, the shaving conditioner is highly effective in providing a lubricated surface so the Norelco head glides on your face. The conditioner has a nice musky scent and is similar to most men's aftershaves. I have used the Nivea conditioner and 8040X on a daily basis for about a week without ANY skin irritation, in-grown hairs, or other skin issues.

This is my first electric razor and I have only used wet bladed razors in the past. 3-4 blades you name it, I tried them all (Mach 3, Mach 3 turbo, Sensor, Schick Quattro) and after the first 2-3 days the blades get dull and my skin gets extremely irritated. To top it off, I have to shave after I shower or else the hairs are too stiff to cut. The Nivea conditioner works well enough that I can just use my 8040x in the morning before I shower and not run into any cutting issues.

Pros: The injection system is pump-action so there are no CFCs or propellants that contribute to ""global warming"", it is very easy to use and is very hygienic especially because of the precise metering system on the Norelco 8040x system.

Cons: Cost. Logistics-wise, the Nivea is going to be more expensive than shaving foams or gels but they rarely provide the same lubricating qualities as the Nivea.

Bottom line: If you enjoy using the 8020x, 8040x, or 8060x, the Nivea is an excellent choice for the wet shaving system.",AN81JUYW2SL24,5.0,5.0,4.0
Philips Norelco HS85 Shaving Unit,5.0,"A lot of reviews for the Norelco Nivea units have been mixed, some people complained that the heads do not have individual motors and others felt that it didn't give a close enough shave as a wet bladed razor. My experience (which may differ from yours) has been that the Norelco HS85 heads provide the closest shave I have gotten since I started shaving. I've tried every bladed razor imaginable from the Mach 3, Mach 3 Turbo, Mach 3 Fusion, Schick Quattro, to the other disposable units but the Norelco just does a better job.

The heads are easy to disassemble and clean and the combs get close enough to the skin that you get a baby-face smooth shave without irritation or pulling hairs.

The only negative aspect is the cost. After buying three of the HS85 heads (over 3 years), you have spent the equivalent money of buying another electric shaver.",AN81JUYW2SL24,5.0,5.0,4.0

We purchased this cape to use when my wife gives me and my son haircuts.

~PROS~
- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

~CONCLUSION~
This cape has made cutting hair easier as it keeps cut hair off of clothes and contains a lot of hair so it can be dumped into the trash can and shaken out outside.",A62S8THB8S60B,4.841870824053452,5.0,4.0

Bonne Bell Smackers Bath and Body Starburst Collection,5.0,"I read that sponges need to be changed once a month... This product combines a body wash and sponge in one! The skin feels so clean each time I used it! And the sponge gives a gentle scrubbing sensation. To prolong its life, I first wash my hair (my body gets wet) turn off the water and scrub/soap-up my whole body with the Spongelle. Once done, I simply rinse off with the shower. This helps reduce water waste and prolong Spongelle's useful life-span. About a month and a half after first use, I start adding some of my favorite body wash. And after three months I replace it with a new one.",A35QTJ23YREVYX,4.841870824053452,5.0,4.0

Bonne Bell Smackers Bath and Body Starburst Collection,5.0,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,AY8XPOPF0OVO5,4.841870824053452,5.0,4.0

Bonne Bell Smackers Bath and Body Starburst Collection,5.0,"This is just divine. I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried. I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life. Taking the morning shower with this baby is the perfect way to start the day.",AJW13PBIXQ33M,4.841870824053452,5.0,4.0

Bonne Bell Smackers Bath and Body Starburst Collection,5.0,"Love this shampoo. I first bought it years ago from Sally's Beauty Supply. I have very coarse hair. It leaves it silky smooth and feels like I don't even need conditioner,  which is a first. I like that it doesn't contain phosphates, because that's not something I want to have to worry about. I'm definitely going to purchase this again. Great shampoo!",A23FCPNAHZDWCZ,4.841870824053452,5.0,4.0
Bonne Bell Smackers Bath and Body Starburst Collection,5.0,"I was so excited when this arrived today, it's the first of many items I need to start up my home salon/barber shop. I assembled it immediately, I then found that 1 screw and another miscellaneous piece was missing.

I'm going to have to go to the local hardware store to see it they have it.

I'm still excited with my purchase as it means I can provide many different types of hair treatments from home or in my client's homes, which means extra income for my family.",A6ZBXOIXMT2K6,4.841870824053452,5.0,4.0
Bonne Bell Smackers Bath and Body Starburst Collection,4.0,"Once you add the five small feet at the bottom, the shampoo bowl stands approximately 38 inches tall before any higher adjustments are made.  The bowl is huge which is great.  It's 10 inches deep and 19 inches at it's widest point.  Assembly instructions could be improved but you can figure out how the pieces fit together.  The draining hose is made of very cheap plastic.  I wasn't able to bend the metal clamp at the right angle to keep the draining hose attached to the metal pole.  Fortunately I have a flexible extension hose from my Synergy Vac that fits perfectly and there are no leaks and no clamps necessary.  Three of the four metal cylinders that goes around the bolts that attaches the metal plate to the bowl wouldn't fit through the holes all the way.  Therefore the nut that attaches to the end of the bolt just barely had enough thread to grip onto to keep the bowl stable.

One design change that would improve these types of bowls is to place the drain hole at the back so that it can be used with a sink.  Otherwise water is best drained using a bathtub, shower or a bucket to catch the water.

I am happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this product especially at this price of under $30.",A1JPDW2ZPSQV8J,4.841870824053452,4.0,4.0

Bonne Bell Smackers Bath and Body Starburst Collection,4.0,"I passed this up several times as it never appealed to me in the store.
I smelled it a couple times but didn't care for it.
Then I received it in a swap with a friend and I finally gave it a try.
So glad I did I really like it.
It has a very unique fragrance something in it reminds me of Twilight woods, from B&BW, not exact but similar.
It has a floral tone and sweetness to it but not overwhelming.
It has a gelatinous texture, comes out kinda thick and gloopy like jelly in a large glob,
but quickly emulsifies with water and thins out.
Makes lots of suds and one big glop will be enough for the whole shower.
I do not notice any softening to the skin compared to regular soap and the scent does not stay on the skin.
Other then that it cleanses well and smells good.
I really like it a lot.",A2PHPWEDA1O7WL,4.841870824053452,4.0,4.0

Bonne Bell Smackers Bath and Body Starburst Collection,5.0,"This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed!  Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

I cannot express enough how much I love this brand. I may joke about the vegan shampoo thing, but everyone who knows me knows how much I adore this company and their products. The fact that the range of products also happens to smell delectable is just a bonus for me. When I moved somewhere where it wasn't easily found in stores I did try some other paraben and sulfate free shampoos and that was SUCH a disaster.

It reminds me of the 70's fragrance, ""Golden Autumn"", also not being made any more.
Today's scents hit my nose in the wrong way, they are either too ""piquant"" with heavy tones of freesia, or too much like bubble gum.
I spent the money and bought Channel No. 5 thinking, I'd just sort ""move up"", and while it smell great at first blush, it turns into just a baby powder smell on me. I can get baby powder for a lot less.

Bonne Bell Smackers Bath and Body Starburst Collection,5.0,"I love the Curl-ease for drying my hair!!  I have 3c 4a curls and in my opinion this is perfect!!  Curl-ease takes out  the perfect amount of moisture and leaves in what my hair needs.  I have tired the Deva Towel and other microfiber towels as well as tee shirts and my hair is left with halo frizz as the micro fiber takes out too much water and the tee shirt is hit or miss.  With the  Curl-ease it is so simply, after putting in leave in conditioner and my styler on wet wet hair and giving my curls a shake I wrap my hair with the curl ease and leave on for 10 to15 minutes. After I am dressed I take it off, give my curls a shake and viola perfect curls every time with NO halo frizz!  I can choose to diffuse if I want but I always air dry as my hair is just damp.  This towel takes the drips away without removing to much water.  I love it better than tee shirts which work Ok but sometime can give my hair a little frizz and are restricting due to having the hole at the top.  The Curl-ease is the perfect size for long or short hair and certainly better than microfiber.  Curl-ease is #1 drying towel in my opinion!!",A1PGXH95LTH5MN,4.841870824053452,5.0,4.0

I also, instead of rinsing straight away, let it sit overnight, washed it, and then repeated the process a few times.

Bonne Bell Smackers Bath and Body Starburst Collection,5.0,"I like cream shampoos. They harken back, which is sometimes nice, but also a container of cream shampoo tends to go further than a container of liquid shampoo. I landed on this and decided to try it.

What I wasn't expecting was that my hair would feel so wonderfully soft and full after the first wash! It lathered beautifully with just a dab of shampoo, rinsed easily and without being fly-away or unmanageable at all, my hair is really so soft. I'm kinda stunned. (As I always do, I rubbed actual coconut oil on my hands and then ran my hands through my hair before blow-drying. But I've always done that. My hair has never felt this good so it isn't because of the light coconut oil finish.)

This cream doesn't really smell anything like coconut oil, but more like a clean baby -- I don't know why.

To note -- at the time I ordered this I didn't realize it was coming from a company in the UK, where I'm not. They delivered in a timely manner, given that the package was sailing across a very large pond, but I'll look for this product from a US distributor the next time I order.

I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation.

Bonne Bell Smackers Bath and Body Starburst Collection,5.0,"The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older. This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it).

I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress Conditioner&nbsp;for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible.

I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress&nbsp;conditioner and&nbsp;Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo&nbsp;(which had a scent I didn't like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  I replaced the shampoo with&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner.

I've tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me.

With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It's not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me.

Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I'm slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance.

The bottom line is using&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.

I'll update the review with observations about the ""strengthening"" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer.

First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner.

Update: Jan 9 2014
Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I'm now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.

What I'm using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it's like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.

Update: Feb 15 2015

I think I'm using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result.

Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.",A31N0XY2UTB25C,4.841870824053452,5.0,4.0

Bonne Bell Smackers Bath and Body Starburst Collection,5.0,"Having given up on bar soap and its innate ability to dry my skin out, I have been using shower gel for years.  Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.",A3N81O636W6H9A,4.841870824053452,5.0,4.0

Bonne Bell Smackers Bath and Body Starburst Collection,5.0,"I, like a lot of people, sometimes take Softsoap with a grain of salt. They smell fantastic, and feel great when you're scrubbing your body, but after you get out of the shower your skin feels kind of waxy.

However, I saw this and couldn't pass it up. Black orchid and velvet? It sounded (and smelled) wonderful! I would be lying if I said I wasn't also attracted to it because it's my favorite color, purple. Softsoap is also pretty reasonable, price wise, so I don't feel bad buying more than one bottle at a time.

This one, thankfully, leaves my skin nothing but silky smooth and smelling wonderful! I have learned the hard way that things that are orchid scented either turn out fresh and delightful, or horribly wrong. This is definitely fresh and delightful.

Commonwealth Lavare Extra Large Pineapple Bath Soap 12 Oz. by CST,5.0,"Dawn is the best detergent for getting stuff clean. Nothing beats it for getting grime and grease of of your pots pans, dishes, and birds.
Wait a minute birds? Yes birds. Dawn is used exclusively in all animal rescues from the exon valdez to the BP spill. The International Bird Rescue Research Center refuses to use anything else in fact. The veterinarians like its gentleness and toughness on gooey oil. They use it every day and wash their own hands with Dawn and it doesn't dry them out.

Dawn is made by procter and gamble, and they have donated over 500 thousand dollars to wildlife groups from the sales of Dawn. I prefer the ultra  original to the platinum as I find the platinum is a little harsher on my hands. The ultra works great for getting dried egg off of my dishes, and put a little in a pot to soak come back and rinse it out with a light brushing.

There are greener cleaners out there as veterinarian and head of the International Bird Rescue Research Center points out, but none of the has dawns magic she says. Dawn has petroleum in it as an ingredient. Probably why it moisturizes / doesn't dry out your hands.
I would have to agree having tried the seventh day cleaners with pretty poor results.",A1JZFGZEZVWQPY,5.0,5.0,4.0
Commonwealth Lavare Extra Large Pineapple Bath Soap 12 Oz. by CST,5.0,"I've used&nbsp;Dawn Original&nbsp;for years and liked it very much. I picked up&nbsp;Dawn Platinum&nbsp;late in 2013 and after 3 months I've used less than Dawn Original and my dishes, silverware, glasses, mugs pots and pans all very clean. BUT my hands are getting dried out when I use it.

I don't use an automatic dishwasher, just the two manual ones at the end of my arms!

During the winter I like to use my&nbsp;Slow Cooker. Anyone who is a slow cooking fan knows it can be a challenge to clean the pot or crock used. Using Dawn Ultra for Soaking loosens stubborn food considerably in a couple of hours. I think it is not quite as effective as Dawn Platinum but still an effective soak.

The scent of Dawn Ultra Original Scent is not unpleasant and is mild. Platinum's scent is more mild and for me less is better.

Both Dawn Ultra and Platinum require less product than Original in my experience. Less frequent purchases save shopping time and money. Both a plus.

The biggest differences for me between Dawn Ultra and Platinum are Platinum drying out my hands  and Platinum may be better for soaking.  In the summer when I'm not soaking as much I think Dawn Ultra is the best choice. Less drying out for the hands. In winter it's much closer. Ultra is a bit better as a soak.

I think Dawn Platinum and Ultra are very close in terms of cleaning. Both are an improvement over Dawn's Original formula dish washing liquid and worth a try.

Hope this helps someone.",A31N0XY2UTB25C,5.0,5.0,4.0
Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer,5.0,my Phillips sonicare uv sanitizer works great on keeping the brush head of my sonicare tooth brush clean and sanitary. use it daily,ABPNZ9RKXOP0E,4.0,5.0,4.0
Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer,5.0,"In a recent ""talk to the the doctor"" on network TV the point was made that the dirtiest item in the bathroom was the toothbrush. It is not just the oral bacteria that is of concern. Fecal bacteria was commonly found on toothbrush handles and bristles. The easiest explanation for this was inadequate hand washing by bathroom users. As a man, I have all too often witnessed other men in public restrooms dodge right past the sink on their way out. So, I am ordering one of these UV sanitizers today. It sure seems like cheap insurance along with some handwashing directions for the family!",A1MTGLL68VNZZB,4.0,5.0,4.0
Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer,3.0,"Let's think about this product for a minute.  You have a toothbrush which supposedly uses sonic waves to clean the teeth.  (I have to believe ""truth in advertising"" laws are at work here, because my Sonicare doesn't produce results that are any better than any battery-operated toothbrush I've used.)  Then you get this item which is designed to sanitize said toothbrush.

How can you really tell if this thing ""sanitizes"" your toothbrush head?  Even if you tried to fake it by putting, say, spaghetti sauce on the toothbrush and then sanitizing it, that still doesn't prove anything.  It hums and then you take your brush head out.  But what are the benefits of sanitizing the brush head?  Again, I notice no difference in my mouth from how things were before I had this, compared to after using this.  So, it does nothing obvious, but if you're paranoid, you might want to get it just to believe you're chasing down every tiny bacterium.",A2SH7OWE8QJYNC,4.0,3.0,4.0
Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer,3.0,"When I first heard about the Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer, I thought
it was an unnecessary device, meant to profit even further off a
hundred-dollar-plus toothbrush. My first thought when I received the
box was, ""Hmm, bigger than I thought."" I read the directions first,
which seemed to require an unusual number of steps to set up and
install the UV bulb. I only noticed later in fine print, ""May come
with bulb pre-installed."" Indeed, that was the case. So I just had to
plug it in.

The outer case presents a pleasing blue glow when operating, and indeed it is easy to operate--just push one button, come back 10 minutes later, done! However, it seems focused on cleaning just the brush head. My real concern is about the dark nastiness that builds up inside the handle base, around the threads, and underneath the ""skirt"" at the base of the brush head. What are you doing about that, Philips?!

Does have little adapters for other brands of toothbrush heads. I thought it wasn't worth the counter space, and considering that a dip into rubbing alcohol would kill everything, too, I left it with my mom at home. She, too, was hoping it would kill the innards. My sister, whose brush-head was part of the initial cycle run, remarked a few days later that she wished she could have had the UV sanitizer when, while traveling, the brush head slipped out, fell to the ground, and was stepped on. Ew.

Anyway, if you're seriously OCD, maybe it's useful. But considering all the other sources of germs that you put into your mouth, your toothbrush shouldn't be a significant concern (again, just soak it in rubbing alcohol). Not worth it. Floss, brush, use Listerine.",A3EFSLEMHNPP6A,4.0,3.0,4.0
Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer,5.0,"I'll give it five stars because it seems to do what it does well.  If you are concerned about the bacteria in your toothbrush and dipping it in alcohol isn't the answer for you then this product has your name written all over it.

I have a Sonicare toothbrush so for me the head of the toothbrush fit inside without a problem.  If you have another model then there are adapters you can put on it so that you can clean any other toothbrush.  But since I don't use them, I can't comment on how well they work.

The cleaning itself is pretty easy.  Just put it in, make sure the brushes are pointed the right way, close the lid, and hit the power button.  Ten minutes later it is done and all those big, bad bacteria are dead... well, 99% of them anyways.

So, there you have it, it works and it is easy to make it work.  What more could you ask for?

As a note, I do want to comment on what another reviewer wrote.  Namely, that people have survived decades without a device like this.  And I'd have to agree.  That is why I mentioned in the title that this may be perfect for hypochondriacs while most people will shrug and wonder what the point is.  For me, it is more of an OCD where I like to be thorough on the things I do.  Therefore, when I give my brush a thorough cleaning (monthly or so) then I like to finish it off inside of this product.  It's all a mental game and if this product makes you feel better/safer then it is worth every penny.",A3F3B6HY9RJI04,4.0,5.0,4.0
Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer,4.0,"You know how annoying it is to keep in mind that every 30-45 days you must throw away your old toothbrush and then find the same kind with the same either soft or medium head and it is never exactly the same and you have to get used to it again and then whole cycle repeats itself?

Well, no more. I have an automatic toothbrush and all I do now is put its head in this neat sanitizer and it kills all the bacteria and I can go on for another 20-30 days without having to worry about repeating this process. The product has UV bulb, which is what actually kills the bacteria. There is an extra brush head holder for different models of brush heads (Oral-B-FlexiSoft and FlossAction and most Sonicare models). I didn't have troubles putting the holder into the Sanitizer. The cleaning takes approximately 10 minutes and when complete it shuts itself off. It was prebuilt with a drip tray to get rid of excess water. This is a great gift for anyone in your family. Folks, it doesn't get any easier or more practical than this.",A28N2AWOVO2PB,4.0,4.0,4.0
Philips Sonicare UV Sanitizer,3.0,"I would have to say that this is probably a good niche product and nice gift for someone who already owns a compatible toothbrush.  It is a handy place to store the brush heads in a sanitary manner (if you believe that the UV light kills the bacteria).

That said, for $50 plus S&H is a bit much for brush storage and cleaning.
The recharging stand has worked well enough for me in the past, and I've never had any issue with bacteria on my brush heads.  Rinse thoroughly after use and tap to get the water out, that should be enough in my opinion.  As the ""biologist"" stated in his review, this seems a bit like overkill.

"Helen of Troy 1579 Tangle Free Hot Air Brush, White, 3/4 Inch Barrel",5.0,"This size 3/4 Helen of Troy Tangle Free Hot Air Brush is EXACTLY what I was searching for for my shorter length, baby fine hair!

1 As a hair dryer...This unit gets hot enough but not too hot. And, it drys my hair quickly.
STYLING: Just before it is fully dry, I use my hand to take the brush move in a circular motion for a fuller look. I lift the dryer up as I curl.
For a more curly look, I tuck the brush under just like it was a curling iron and leave it for about 10 to 15 seconds per curl.

2 DRY STYLING - I use this just like a curling iron, however, since I have dry hair, I place just a half dime sized to dime sized amount of VO5 and massage this into my scalp and hair BEFORE I style with this brush...this gives my hair a shiny, healthy look.
If you have oily or normal hair, just spray/spritz a tiny bit of water from a water spray bottle between shampoos to freshen/style...do this before your dry style. It only takes a very tiny amount of water for this.

3 Two levels...High and low. I use the High for brush drying and the Low for Styling.

4 I like thag there us an ON/OFF button on the plug area and also on the brush.

5 The quality of this is amazing, The brush/dryer is quiet.

6 The brush removes for easy cleaning.

7 The brush is tangle free in my hair, much better than a nylon bristled type.

I have tried loofahs in the past and was never a big fan but I gave the Urban Spa Loofah a try and Im glad that I did.

I like that it has an attached ribbon and suction cup. I thought that the suction cup being attached would bother me as I used it but it has not. Its nice that I can hang it on my shower door.

The material is nice and it was easy to blow up.  It is very soft to lay on, but you do have to have a place to let it dry, because the material is like a terry cloth material and it absorbs a lot of water.  I would only suggest ordering this if you have a bathtub that is slick, and not dimpled.  Porcelain or ceramic would be best.  Mine is plastic with dimples and that might be one of the reasons it wouldn't stay in place.

I saturate them in hibiclens, rinse and then squirt a bit of hydrogen peroxide, rinse thoroughly and allow to dry completely. It's a process and really more than I want to do. That's why these glove are so great!

When you put them on and they stretch out a bit they have tons of tiny pockets/holes and they hold plenty of shower gel or even just lather when you use bar soap (my preference). I start with my face and then work my way down. Super easy and quick and when I'm done, I can just throw them in with some towels and wash. I did hang them over a towel rod to dry because they are for exfoliation and a bit rough so you wouldn't want to wash them with more delicate stuff and even not with your nice towels but it didn't look like they harmed my everyday towels at all.

I felt squeaky clean when done but not raw or anything. They might be a bit much for people with sensitive skin on their faces but they work fabulously for me. I just put on a bit of moisturizer after, let it soak in and it was super easy to put foundation on because there was no dead/dry patches on my face to have to ""fix"".

You only get one mitt which has a soft exfoliating surface that is less harsh than a loofah yet still exfoliates effectively.

The mitt is thin and it fits my hand normally if not a little loose. I have large hands.  I was perplexed by all the reviews about these being small.  Maybe this points to a QC issue?

It performs well in the shower - gently abrasing skin.  I use it with a high quality body wash.

I would have liked for it to have some way to hang it but there was no hole or loop. And the actual file paper is not on correctly on one side. Just seems a bit slipshod in make.

I put my regular application of hand cream on, and worked it in, and then, prepping for sleep, I put a big glob on my hands and rubbed it all around, sort of like you do on the face with a mask or hair with deep conditioner.  But the gloves are snug; some of the cream actually was pushed down to my wrist by the action of struggling into the gloves, and the rest of it soaked into the glove fabric once I had the gloves on.  I took them off a few minutes later because they were so tight on my hands (I wear size 7 gloves so my hands are not that outrageously big.)

I found that the suction cups really do work, they merely require a moment of set up before one is actually leaning against it. Set it up when outside the tub and it stayed in place well enough for me when only 2 suction cups were made to stick to the tub. To be direct, it's too much effort to make more than 2 suction cups stick.

The pillow dries quickly. On the back side is only plastic and the front side has the microfiber but it's real thin. It would feel awful if one had the plastic against one's skin, that's why the microfiber is used.

"Urban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized",2.0,"Note: The company has several products linked together which can lead to a misleading / confusing time reading reviews. This is for the booties.

I was really excited to try these moisturizing booties. Unfortunately, they did not love up to my expectations. First of all, I thought they would moisturize my feet just by wearing them as indicated in the name. They don't. You are supposed to put cream or lotion on your feet before putting them on. This means that the cream/lotion is moisturizing your feet, not the booties. I used to rub lotion on my feet and then wear socks to bed which does the same thing.

I wore these booties to bed and they immediately started annoying me. They have thick seams right at the toes and again at the heel. I couldn't stop rubbing the seams trying to make them more comfortable. Do they help hold in the heat and allow the lotion to really moisturize? Yes. So do socks. I have a pair of really soft, fluffy socks that have the same effect and are more comfortable.

Sadly, I cannot recommend these booties. I would suggest getting a really comfortable pair of socks and using them for the same thing. You can probably find them cheaper and they will work just as well.",A39WWMBA0299ZF,4.117241379310345,2.0,4.0

The large blunt nosed tweezers will grip and pluck a very fine hair/splinter/whatever. The curved shears are very sharp and sturdy and will clip anything you need clipped.

It isn't that they are big though, they just really stretch out to fit.  they work great, they feel just a bit scratchy but in use they make a soap lather well and really help get the top layer of dead skin off so that when I towel off, I just get clean and don't end up with rolls of skin that should have been washed away.  It seems like at least once a week I shed skin like crazy if I don't exfoliate, so I've used gloves like this for a few years now.

These are about the same quality as most others I've used, although I have used worse.  The price is a bit high perhaps but I am glad they are offered online.  The pair I got had strong seams, but if I have any issues with them not lasting a normal period of time, I will update the review.

The pair I received was a gorgeous aqua color.  They come nicely labeled and would look nice as part of a homemade gift basket.

These come in handy too before using fake tanning creams or lotions.  They will shorten the life of a tan though and can be used to help get rid of fake tan streaks or splotches.  They do wear out.  I don't keep mine but at most a month even if they still look ok.  I have never seen a recommended lifespan on them.

"Urban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized",3.0,"For me, the lack of angle on the handle made this difficult to use. I think just a bit of a curve or maybe some flex would have helped. I'm also not sure it will stand up to long use simply because it feels a bit slim. Mind you I'm not trying to break it. And it did put up with me sawing away at my heels.

I would have liked for it to have some way to hang it but there was no hole or loop. And the actual file paper is not on correctly on one side. Just seems a bit slipshod in make.

So it works but it's not something I would give as a gift due to the lack of pride in workmanship. I guess you get what you pay for.",A2TDWDE3ZSSCA1,4.117241379310345,3.0,4.0
"Urban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized",4.0,"Urban Spa Get a Grip Trio Manicure and Pedicure kit is a typical set of tweezers,clippers and small scissors with the added element of blue gripping material. My one complaint is on the tweezers it needs grip on both sides not just one. In order to use without pain from the sharp angles of the large size of the tweezers I turned it around backwards from how I usually hold it. It was hurting my hand to use it what I consider to be the right direction. The gripper on the tweezers and the scissors helps the tools not slip or slide. Rating 4 stars = Like It due to the design flaw with the tweezers. I also like the blue so this is acceptable for use by my husband and sons.",A3SMR4HRFJARSC,4.117241379310345,4.0,4.0

It has been a really long time since I used a pair of adult size clippers that worked so well. Since my kids were born, some 30 years ago, I started and continue to use their baby clippers, finding them the only ones that work well. All three items in the kit works well, and are well made, but I am most excited about the clippers. Thank goodness for a full size pair that FINALLY work well.

"Urban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized",4.0,"Everyone has a need for a nail brush. On the top of the unit, you get a tight row of curved bristles, which are great for getting under your nails. The bottom is all brush and you can use it to remove dead skin and overgrown cuticles. Works best wet and with soap. It is easy to hold. After using, you will want to let it air dry and keep it away from water and steam when you are not using, I say this because I have had to throw more than one bristled brush away because they get mildew when you leave them in a shower.",A25QBCHO0KFT0P,4.117241379310345,4.0,4.0

When I wear sandals all day, my heels can get ruff and dry looking so I feel it is important to take proper care of them.  My overall impression of this buffing brush was light way and perhaps not super expensive.  I didn't feel much of a grit difference between the two sides of the brush, I wish one side was grittier than the other side.  I did feel like overall it did a nice job on my heels and pad of my foot.  I typically like to use these dry but you can also use this one wet.  I have used about 4 times and overall the grit is holding up fairly well compared to other files that I have purchased before.",A3TMBYDFP1B9DM,4.117241379310345,4.0,4.0

"Urban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized",1.0,"I have often heard about this type of product and I always assumed they would be lined with plastic of some kind, something non-absorbent, because otherwise, your hand cream would soak into the fabric, right?  Well, they are NOT lined with plastic, and the hand cream DID soak into them.  I put my regular application of hand cream on, and worked it in, and then, prepping for sleep, I put a big glob on my hands and rubbed it all around, sort of like you do on the face with a mask or hair with deep conditioner.  But the gloves are snug; some of the cream actually was pushed down to my wrist by the action of struggling into the gloves, and the rest of it soaked into the glove fabric once I had the gloves on.  I took them off a few minutes later because they were so tight on my hands (I wear size 7 gloves so my hands are not that outrageously big.)  As a process I don't recommend this, but if you are willing to deal with the drawbacks, you might like these.  But for me, I'll just keep moisturizing my hands before bed as usual.",A2SH7OWE8QJYNC,4.117241379310345,1.0,4.0
"Urban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized",4.0,"This is about the same quality foot file as the ones I pick up in the check out aisle.  Half of the useful things in life are in the check out aisle.  The price is pretty comparable.

Generally I end up getting these when I am on the road and don't have a nail file or my Amope pedi device with me or any number of times I end up in a different town that I planned to be.  It happens.",A2503LT8PZIHAD,4.117241379310345,4.0,4.0
"Urban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized",5.0,"The product photo makes the bath pillow look large but it's small. I'm glad it's small too. It's not that easy to blow up but possible - you have to squeeze the nozzle when blowing in.

I found that the suction cups really do work, they merely require a moment of set up before one is actually leaning against it. Set it up when outside the tub and it stayed in place well enough for me when only 2 suction cups were made to stick to the tub. To be direct, it's too much effort to make more than 2 suction cups stick.

The pillow dries quickly. On the back side is only plastic and the front side has the microfiber but it's real thin. It would feel awful if one had the plastic against one's skin, that's why the microfiber is used.

It's not a high-end item in my opinion. The reason I feel it gets 5-stars is that it does fit on the tub while one is leaning back on it. It's the shape, that's why it works and others probably don't.",A3NHUQ33CFH3VM,4.117241379310345,5.0,4.0
"Urban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized",2.0,"Note: The company has several products linked together which can lead to a misleading / confusing time reading reviews. This is for the booties.

I was really excited to try these moisturizing booties. Unfortunately, they did not love up to my expectations. First of all, I thought they would moisturize my feet just by wearing them as indicated in the name. They don't. You are supposed to put cream or lotion on your feet before putting them on. This means that the cream/lotion is moisturizing your feet, not the booties. I used to rub lotion on my feet and then wear socks to bed which does the same thing.

I wore these booties to bed and they immediately started annoying me. They have thick seams right at the toes and again at the heel. I couldn't stop rubbing the seams trying to make them more comfortable. Do they help hold in the heat and allow the lotion to really moisturize? Yes. So do socks. I have a pair of really soft, fluffy socks that have the same effect and are more comfortable.

Sadly, I cannot recommend these booties. I would suggest getting a really comfortable pair of socks and using them for the same thing. You can probably find them cheaper and they will work just as well.",A39WWMBA0299ZF,4.117241379310345,2.0,4.0

"Urban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized",5.0,"Review for Trio Manicure and Pedicure set. The set I received had white gripper sections rather than blue. Oh well. When I looked at the package, the tools appeared clunky. Fortunately, that is not the case. While they don't look sleek and pricey, they work very well. The large blunt nosed tweezers will grip and pluck a very fine hair/splinter/whatever. The curved shears are very sharp and sturdy and will clip anything you need clipped. The nail clippers are likewise sharp and sturdy and will neatly clip the thickest nails. Both sides of the lever on the nail clipper are rubberized.
These implements are a great addition to my bathroom!",A2X3L31KCXBHCL,4.117241379310345,5.0,4.0

It's a good size, too -- I have large hands it's a little bigger than the size of my palm, which makes it easy to hold. I'd give this five stars if it were just a bit less expensive. It's not over-priced (this is a natural sponge, after all), but it's not exactly a steal, either. Still, it's a good buy.",A7C77J4MH94B6,4.117241379310345,4.0,4.0

"Urban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized",4.0,"These fit even my fat, large hands.  They are pretty easy for me to put on too.  It isn't that they are big though, they just really stretch out to fit.  they work great, they feel just a bit scratchy but in use they make a soap lather well and really help get the top layer of dead skin off so that when I towel off, I just get clean and don't end up with rolls of skin that should have been washed away.  It seems like at least once a week I shed skin like crazy if I don't exfoliate, so I've used gloves like this for a few years now.

These are about the same quality as most others I've used, although I have used worse.  The price is a bit high perhaps but I am glad they are offered online.  The pair I got had strong seams, but if I have any issues with them not lasting a normal period of time, I will update the review.

The pair I received was a gorgeous aqua color.  They come nicely labeled and would look nice as part of a homemade gift basket.

These come in handy too before using fake tanning creams or lotions.  They will shorten the life of a tan though and can be used to help get rid of fake tan streaks or splotches.  They do wear out.  I don't keep mine but at most a month even if they still look ok.  I have never seen a recommended lifespan on them.

I also reviewed the
Urban Spa Volcanic Pumice Stone

It is natural pumice.  In fact, mine had a couple of spots of granite? apparent where the pumice was cut from the top of some volcanic flow.  It is shaped great to fit well in the hand and works great on feet without hurting.  I would give the pumice stone a 5 star rating.  It isn't the gray crumbly pumice, it is hard, red, mineral infused pumice that is more durable.",A2R1HUYHXV7H18,4.117241379310345,4.0,4.0

"Urban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized",3.0,"this is a cute shower cap. It comes in a little plastic envelope with a snap making it easy to tuck in a suitcase. The teal pattern is pleasant. The cap itself is unlined and made of rather crinkly plastic. The elastic is covered with white plastic. I've been growing out my hair and it is now past my shoulders. I was pleased that this cap was able to accommodate it all. The plastic is waterproof. the cap should fit most head sizes.

I use shower caps when airbrushing makeup and when actually painting the interior of my house as well as for showers and deep conditioning. This one certainly performs as well as any. the pattern is pretty but it is not especially comfortable or well made. especially considering the price point.

I received mine in one of my Birchboxes and I couldn't believe the difference compared to drug store shaving creams.  I had no idea it was possible for my legs to feel so hydrated and smooth after shaving.

Be careful not to confuse the pink packaging.  The bottle shown is pomegranate, so if you received a Whish in your Birchbox, and are looking for the Acai Grapefruit, this is not it.  Just look before you buy.

The price point is great considering it's only a few dollars more than drug store shaving creams and leaves your skin feeling like you just stepped out of the spa.",AON853FSY8RNJ,4.5,5.0,4.0
"Whish Coconut Shaving Cream - Smooth, All Natural Shave Cream for Men &amp; Women, Leaves Skin so Soft, Shea Butter and Coconut Oil, Natural and Organic Skin Care - 5 oz. pump",4.0,"As a shaving cream, this performs well.  It's moisturizing and it washes off without leaving residue.  It works even with razors that are kind of dull (which is good, because I forget to change my razor out as often as I should) -- I didn't cut myself at all.

Because this isn't a foaming product, you do have to use more than you would with some competing products.  I found it non-irritating, too.  (You can see the full ingredients list if you scroll down the main product page.)

This does have a strong smell.  I kind of like it, but I have heard from plenty of people who detest the scent.  It's an artificial blueberry sort of scent.  So if you have reactions to strong fragrances, you may want to stay away.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,4.5,3.5,4.0

I did like the smell (fruity) and I appreciate that it doesn't seem to have any artificial dyes since my skin is sometimes sensitive. Please note that while this does contain some plant oils and extracts, it also contains artificial fragrance.

When distributed from the container, it has an airy texture. However, it doesn't foam terribly well, so when you spread it out over the area to be shaved (I used it on my lower legs), it can be hard to see. (I could feel it, though, if I ran my finger over my legs.)

I do think this helped in terms of providing a close, fairly smooth shave. My legs were soft afterwards, though I did also use a body lotion.

Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,5.0,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,AY8XPOPF0OVO5,4.853683668212262,5.0,4.0

Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,5.0,"This is just divine. I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried. I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

I assembled it immediately, I then found that 1 screw and another miscellaneous piece was missing.

I'm going to have to go to the local hardware store to see it they have it.

I'm still excited with my purchase as it means I can provide many different types of hair treatments from home or in my client's homes, which means extra income for my family.",A6ZBXOIXMT2K6,4.853683668212262,5.0,4.0
Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,4.0,"Once you add the five small feet at the bottom, the shampoo bowl stands approximately 38 inches tall before any higher adjustments are made.  The bowl is huge which is great.  It's 10 inches deep and 19 inches at it's widest point.  Assembly instructions could be improved but you can figure out how the pieces fit together.  The draining hose is made of very cheap plastic.  I wasn't able to bend the metal clamp at the right angle to keep the draining hose attached to the metal pole.  Fortunately I have a flexible extension hose from my Synergy Vac that fits perfectly and there are no leaks and no clamps necessary.  Three of the four metal cylinders that goes around the bolts that attaches the metal plate to the bowl wouldn't fit through the holes all the way.  Therefore the nut that attaches to the end of the bolt just barely had enough thread to grip onto to keep the bowl stable.

One design change that would improve these types of bowls is to place the drain hole at the back so that it can be used with a sink.  Otherwise water is best drained using a bathtub, shower or a bucket to catch the water.

I am happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this product especially at this price of under $30.",A1JPDW2ZPSQV8J,4.853683668212262,4.0,4.0

I smelled it a couple times but didn't care for it.
Then I received it in a swap with a friend and I finally gave it a try.
So glad I did I really like it.
It has a very unique fragrance something in it reminds me of Twilight woods, from B&BW, not exact but similar.
It has a floral tone and sweetness to it but not overwhelming.
It has a gelatinous texture, comes out kinda thick and gloopy like jelly in a large glob,
but quickly emulsifies with water and thins out.
Makes lots of suds and one big glop will be enough for the whole shower.
I do not notice any softening to the skin compared to regular soap and the scent does not stay on the skin.
Other then that it cleanses well and smells good.

Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,5.0,"This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed!  Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,5.0,"I love the Curl-ease for drying my hair!!  I have 3c 4a curls and in my opinion this is perfect!!  Curl-ease takes out  the perfect amount of moisture and leaves in what my hair needs.  I have tired the Deva Towel and other microfiber towels as well as tee shirts and my hair is left with halo frizz as the micro fiber takes out too much water and the tee shirt is hit or miss.  With the  Curl-ease it is so simply, after putting in leave in conditioner and my styler on wet wet hair and giving my curls a shake I wrap my hair with the curl ease and leave on for 10 to15 minutes. After I am dressed I take it off, give my curls a shake and viola perfect curls every time with NO halo frizz!  I can choose to diffuse if I want but I always air dry as my hair is just damp.  This towel takes the drips away without removing to much water.  I love it better than tee shirts which work Ok but sometime can give my hair a little frizz and are restricting due to having the hole at the top.  The Curl-ease is the perfect size for long or short hair and certainly better than microfiber.  Curl-ease is #1 drying towel in my opinion!!",A1PGXH95LTH5MN,4.853683668212262,5.0,4.0

(Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation.

Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,5.0,"The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older. This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it).

I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress Conditioner&nbsp;for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible.

I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress&nbsp;conditioner and&nbsp;Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo&nbsp;(which had a scent I didn't like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  I replaced the shampoo with&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner.

I've tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me.

With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It's not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me.

Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I'm slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance.

The bottom line is using&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.

I'll update the review with observations about the ""strengthening"" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer.

First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner.

Update: Jan 9 2014
Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I'm now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.

What I'm using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it's like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.

Update: Feb 15 2015

I think I'm using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result.

Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.",A31N0XY2UTB25C,4.853683668212262,5.0,4.0

Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,5.0,"Having given up on bar soap and its innate ability to dry my skin out, I have been using shower gel for years.  Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.",A3N81O636W6H9A,4.853683668212262,5.0,4.0

Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,5.0,"I, like a lot of people, sometimes take Softsoap with a grain of salt. They smell fantastic, and feel great when you're scrubbing your body, but after you get out of the shower your skin feels kind of waxy.

However, I saw this and couldn't pass it up. Black orchid and velvet? It sounded (and smelled) wonderful! I would be lying if I said I wasn't also attracted to it because it's my favorite color, purple. Softsoap is also pretty reasonable, price wise, so I don't feel bad buying more than one bottle at a time.

This one, thankfully, leaves my skin nothing but silky smooth and smelling wonderful! I have learned the hard way that things that are orchid scented either turn out fresh and delightful, or horribly wrong. This is definitely fresh and delightful.

- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

~CONCLUSION~

This one has a similar impact. I use it as body wash too, but if you do it I recommend using a loofa to increase the longevity of the bottle. I've been using mine for four months and it only just now ran out. I have used it conservatively, maybe two times or three a week. I use the perfume too, but even with the perfume, my skin and hair still smells like the product for a few hours into the day.

Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,5.0,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,AY8XPOPF0OVO5,4.853683668212262,5.0,4.0

Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,5.0,"This is just divine. I love every single I Coloniali product I ever tried. I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

I assembled it immediately, I then found that 1 screw and another miscellaneous piece was missing.

I'm going to have to go to the local hardware store to see it they have it.

I'm still excited with my purchase as it means I can provide many different types of hair treatments from home or in my client's homes, which means extra income for my family.",A6ZBXOIXMT2K6,4.853683668212262,5.0,4.0
Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,4.0,"Once you add the five small feet at the bottom, the shampoo bowl stands approximately 38 inches tall before any higher adjustments are made.  The bowl is huge which is great.  It's 10 inches deep and 19 inches at it's widest point.  Assembly instructions could be improved but you can figure out how the pieces fit together.  The draining hose is made of very cheap plastic.  I wasn't able to bend the metal clamp at the right angle to keep the draining hose attached to the metal pole.  Fortunately I have a flexible extension hose from my Synergy Vac that fits perfectly and there are no leaks and no clamps necessary.  Three of the four metal cylinders that goes around the bolts that attaches the metal plate to the bowl wouldn't fit through the holes all the way.  Therefore the nut that attaches to the end of the bolt just barely had enough thread to grip onto to keep the bowl stable.

One design change that would improve these types of bowls is to place the drain hole at the back so that it can be used with a sink.  Otherwise water is best drained using a bathtub, shower or a bucket to catch the water.

I am happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this product especially at this price of under $30.",A1JPDW2ZPSQV8J,4.853683668212262,4.0,4.0

I smelled it a couple times but didn't care for it.
Then I received it in a swap with a friend and I finally gave it a try.
So glad I did I really like it.
It has a very unique fragrance something in it reminds me of Twilight woods, from B&BW, not exact but similar.
It has a floral tone and sweetness to it but not overwhelming.
It has a gelatinous texture, comes out kinda thick and gloopy like jelly in a large glob,
but quickly emulsifies with water and thins out.
Makes lots of suds and one big glop will be enough for the whole shower.
I do not notice any softening to the skin compared to regular soap and the scent does not stay on the skin.
Other then that it cleanses well and smells good.

Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,5.0,"This is a ridiculous price and the seller should be ashamed!  Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,5.0,"I love the Curl-ease for drying my hair!!  I have 3c 4a curls and in my opinion this is perfect!!  Curl-ease takes out  the perfect amount of moisture and leaves in what my hair needs.  I have tired the Deva Towel and other microfiber towels as well as tee shirts and my hair is left with halo frizz as the micro fiber takes out too much water and the tee shirt is hit or miss.  With the  Curl-ease it is so simply, after putting in leave in conditioner and my styler on wet wet hair and giving my curls a shake I wrap my hair with the curl ease and leave on for 10 to15 minutes. After I am dressed I take it off, give my curls a shake and viola perfect curls every time with NO halo frizz!  I can choose to diffuse if I want but I always air dry as my hair is just damp.  This towel takes the drips away without removing to much water.  I love it better than tee shirts which work Ok but sometime can give my hair a little frizz and are restricting due to having the hole at the top.  The Curl-ease is the perfect size for long or short hair and certainly better than microfiber.  Curl-ease is #1 drying towel in my opinion!!",A1PGXH95LTH5MN,4.853683668212262,5.0,4.0

I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,5.0,"The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older. This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it).

I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress Conditioner&nbsp;for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible.

I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress&nbsp;conditioner and&nbsp;Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo&nbsp;(which had a scent I didn't like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  I replaced the shampoo with&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner.

I've tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me.

With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It's not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me.

Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I'm slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance.

The bottom line is using&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.

I'll update the review with observations about the ""strengthening"" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer.

First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner.

Update: Jan 9 2014
Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I'm now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.

What I'm using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it's like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.

Update: Feb 15 2015

I think I'm using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result.

Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.",A31N0XY2UTB25C,4.853683668212262,5.0,4.0

Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,5.0,"Having given up on bar soap and its innate ability to dry my skin out, I have been using shower gel for years.  Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz,5.0,"I, like a lot of people, sometimes take Softsoap with a grain of salt. They smell fantastic, and feel great when you're scrubbing your body, but after you get out of the shower your skin feels kind of waxy.

However, I saw this and couldn't pass it up. Black orchid and velvet? It sounded (and smelled) wonderful! I would be lying if I said I wasn't also attracted to it because it's my favorite color, purple. Softsoap is also pretty reasonable, price wise, so I don't feel bad buying more than one bottle at a time.

This one, thankfully, leaves my skin nothing but silky smooth and smelling wonderful! I have learned the hard way that things that are orchid scented either turn out fresh and delightful, or horribly wrong. This is definitely fresh and delightful. If you are a fan of Olay's orchid body wash, or a fan of orchid in general, definitely give this a try.",A2D0I7M2G43WWP,4.853683668212262,5.0,4.0

~PROS~
- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

~CONCLUSION~
This cape has made cutting hair easier as it keeps cut hair off of clothes and contains a lot of hair so it can be dumped into the trash can and shaken out outside.",A62S8THB8S60B,4.853683668212262,5.0,4.0

"Williams Lectric Shave, 7 Ounce",3.0,"I just recently started shaving again with an electric razor after 40 years of blades. I bought the&nbsp;Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue&nbsp;and absolutely love it. Today's razors are so much better than years ago.

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor.

"Williams Lectric Shave, 7 Ounce",3.0,"I recently started using an electric razor after years of being a supporter of the wet shave market.  Mostly for times when it's convenient and I am in a hurry.  I remember years ago when I used an electric shaver that this Williams lectric shave worked well in making a difference in a close shave.  Picking up a bottle after all these years proves that it still does, and in my opinion a pre shave lotion is a good investment for electric razor users.  That being said, I have to say that somewhere along the line Williams changed their formula somewhat, at least in the scent, for its not the same as I remember to be sure.  Years ago this pre shave smelled as nice as any after shave did.  It was a pleasant but not too strong barber shop sort of spice scent. Now it seems to have a very weak but not at all likable scent that despite its lack of strength still seems to linger on after you shave, even with a rinse.  It reminds me very much of those cheap after shave rip offs you can find in some dollar stores that go on smelling nice for a few minutes, but then quickly turn sour and cheap...  As good as this works at stimulating your beard with a splash of alcohol and other ingredients, my recommendation is to use Afta brand pre shave which I picked up at a local pharmacy, but is also readily available here on Amazon in a two pack at the time of this writing.  In fact I have ordered some here simply because Afta's availability locally is spotty at best.  Williams seems to have a marketing hold in my neck of the woods because its also easy to find.  But I still recommend this only if you don't have any Afta available.  Afta smells much better, works as well if not better than the Willians, and unlike the Williams, to my knowledge has always been the same formula....&nbsp;Mennen Afta Pre-Electric original 3 FL OZ (PACK OF 2)",A35W3JQYP0M655,4.485714285714286,3.0,4.0

With that said - it makes my Braun 8985 shaver glide across my face like greased ice. The closeness is still about 95% that of my old Gillette Mach3 Turbo wet razor. I love my electric shaver even more now....",A209D39LSIHOHO,4.485714285714286,5.0,4.0

The smell is terrible, however. You will want to be sure to wash it off your face after shaving.
The stubble that collects in my shaver also seems to clump and stick more with this product, which requires a little more cleaning of the shaver.
You should also wash your hands very well after applying it. If not, it will permanently stain/discolor your hand towels.
I also noticed that the plastic shelf in my medicine cabinet has melted in the area where I keep the Lectric Shave. I think some drips down the side of the bottle after I apply it, which melted the plastic.

"Williams Lectric Shave, 7 Ounce",3.0,"I recently started using an electric razor after years of being a supporter of the wet shave market.  Mostly for times when it's convenient and I am in a hurry.  I remember years ago when I used an electric shaver that this Williams lectric shave worked well in making a difference in a close shave.  Picking up a bottle after all these years proves that it still does, and in my opinion a pre shave lotion is a good investment for electric razor users.  That being said, I have to say that somewhere along the line Williams changed their formula somewhat, at least in the scent, for its not the same as I remember to be sure.  Years ago this pre shave smelled as nice as any after shave did.  It was a pleasant but not too strong barber shop sort of spice scent. Now it seems to have a very weak but not at all likable scent that despite its lack of strength still seems to linger on after you shave, even with a rinse.  It reminds me very much of those cheap after shave rip offs you can find in some dollar stores that go on smelling nice for a few minutes, but then quickly turn sour and cheap...  As good as this works at stimulating your beard with a splash of alcohol and other ingredients, my recommendation is to use Afta brand pre shave which I picked up at a local pharmacy, but is also readily available here on Amazon in a two pack at the time of this writing.  In fact I have ordered some here simply because Afta's availability locally is spotty at best.  Williams seems to have a marketing hold in my neck of the woods because its also easy to find.  But I still recommend this only if you don't have any Afta available.  Afta smells much better, works as well if not better than the Willians, and unlike the Williams, to my knowledge has always been the same formula....&nbsp;Mennen Afta Pre-Electric original 3 FL OZ (PACK OF 2)",A35W3JQYP0M655,4.485714285714286,3.0,4.0

CocoCare Cococare 100% Cocoa Butter Stick Pack of 1,5.0,"I am moving towards using natural products on skin, hair,etc. One step I have taken is to stop using Vaseline and other petroleum products. The only problem I had was the fact that Vaseline was the only product that kept my feet moisturized while I wore sandals.

One day I saw the Cococare Cocoa Butter Stick at CVS and decided to give it a try. I rubbed the stick on my feet followed by a touch of olive oil. The mixture kept my feet supple and moisturized all day while I walked around in sandals! The mixture absorbed into my skin wonderfully.

CocoCare Cococare 100% Cocoa Butter Stick Pack of 1,4.0,"I bought a one-ounce stick at my local health food store, for two bucks. Because I have allergies, it is important to try products without huge financial investment, so this seems reasonable.

Right now I am using it on my (now happy) lips, rather than the commercial products that have additives with long chemical names. I plan to also use it on the place where my computer stool has made unpleasant calluses as well as on my elbows that rest on the desk until I think to stop that behavior.

The cocoa butter is most pleasant and the cocoa smell is there but not very strong - quite acceptable. It does seem to be a particularly effective emollient and is quite without any of the additives that experts are advising us to stay away from. (Think ""dimethicone"", a silicon polymer that makes products more spreadable but unfortunately forms an impenetrable barrier that, while it may prevent moisture loss, also traps bacteria, etc. and prevents normal transpiration and absorption of necessary medications you apply later, is an allergen for some plus is not biodegradable and these days is found in a huge majority of skin products. Whew. Isn't it disgusting that manufacturers DON'T CARE?)

This cocoa butter stick comes packaged in a plastic tube with a manual push-up feature that means that with each use, if you want to recap it, you must push it back down. So far so good - the cap itself pushes it down without creating a mess, at least at 55F. But it doesn't bode well for this coming summer.

Ole Henriksen Three Little Wonders Mini Box Set-3 ct,4.0,"This is a great introductory set that I purchased from QVC, for quite a bit less than what Amazon sells it for. I saw Ole Henriksen present his products, and he seemed to know the beauty and in particular the skin business.

The Truth Serum is my favorite of the three products. My face seems smoother and feels smooth and fresh after using it. I use it morning and night after cleansing my face. Moisturizer Creme seems to slide on over this serum. The Transformation Cream is OK, but I have another I prefer. The Invigorating Night Gel is exactly that, you can feel your skin tingle after application. I have not noted any real difference using this gel, but it has a nice feel. It feels sticky at first,but then fades away to smooth.

This kind if mini kit is a perfect method to try new products, and to decide what may work for you. I will certainly purchase the Truth Serum again.

The scent is wonderful and matches perfectly with the deodorant line.  My husband finds that with the use of this soap it is not necessary for him to apply deodorant.  Not sure if this is a rare occurence but it is happening to my husband; which is another positive for him.

For the ""Dry Skin Hydrator"", my husband does not necessarily suffer from dry skin all the time, only during certain times of the year.  His skin feels very soft and supple!

Finally, it is a very thick body wash which needs to be applied to either a wash cloth or loofah.  That way you will be able to evenly distribute the wash and use a lesser amount opposed to putting it on your hand.

I really loved it, the wash is silky smooth and lathers into plenty of cleansing bubbles without stripping moisture away...I think people who are used to soap and the tight extra clean feeling they get, find a moisturizing body wash strange, but sapping all moisture from the skin with soap is not good, if you don't moisturize afterwards all that water is escaping and creating wrinkles and discomfort. My boyfriend really liked this, he never uses any lotions but sometimes the skin on his upper back hurts as he says and I have to massage it with thick creams because it's in distress, but after using this for a while he doesn't need the cream as much, which I don't mind putting on but I'm happy that his skin isn't bothering him anymore.

Dried Fruit &amp; Nut Medley 3lb 8oz Bag,5.0,"I carry my lunches to work. Every day I put an assortment of things into a little lunch pack and then snack off and on during the working hours. I try to keep the food healthy, low in processed sugars and in fats. The more natural it is, the better I like it. One of the items I take on an irregular basis is Kirkland Signature Fruit & Nut medley. I buy it in a big re-sealable 56-ounce bag at my local warehouse store. I put a small handful in a sandwich bag along with the rest of my lunch. I love this stuff. Delicious!

Philips Norelco 7310 Men's Shaving System,4.0,"Since high school, I have owned corded and cordless shavers from almost all the major brands.  In my humble opinion, the Norelco and Panasonic are the two best.  It comes down to whether you like a foil or a rotary head style.

Personally,I found this as great rotary dollar for dollar. I had a clipless coupon here on Amazon and there was an amazing price before the coupon.  The shaver was less than $20. On price alone, it's a 5 star deal.

But price isn't everything.  I like the durability, and Philips uses cheaper plastic than my shavers from the late 1990's  early 2000's .  The charging cord is also flimsy.

They do score major points with the ability to rinse the heads under water.

So for an entry or slightly above entry level, you won't be disappointed.  If you like more meat on the bone, go up a few models.",A19FRW264WZTGP,4.666666666666667,4.0,4.0
Philips Norelco 7310 Men's Shaving System,5.0,"This Norelco 7310XL does an excellent job of sharpley cutting away the face hair. And it cost me only about $35, a far cry from the many Norelcos that are touted and can cost approximately $200. This Norelco is excellent in its simplicity. It does not have those many sophisticated automated lighted controls--it simply does the shaving well. When you open the razor up, it gives you the impression of being made with basic materials. It does not have the luxurious display to indicate to you that the charge is about to expire. You mostly have to estimate on your own that the device requires recharging. Yet, this Norelco does a much better job at trimming the beard than many much more expensive Norelcos that I have used. Also, your chin will feel a bit of irritation wnen you first use this razor; but after a couple of weeks, that feeling of chin irritation will be gone. The razor is also easy to clean and disassemble. All in all you get an inexpensive basic razor that performs excellently. No frills, but the job gets done! And it seems that the razor is durable enough to last for a long time. I bought the razor, based on the good reviews. The reviews are so many, and the price of the razor has noticeably gone up!

Philips Norelco 7310 Men's Shaving System,5.0,"I'm touching my bald head as I type this. Granted, the cutters are new but after 24 hours my head is still noticeably smooth. It did a darn good job. I also like fact that the shaver head is slightly rubbery which makes ""cleaning by tapping it against the sink"" feel less damaging to the shaver and the sink. Sadly, the amount you pay for a shaver has nothing to do with the quality of the shave. Get this one and spend your money on a dinner date.

I've owned many electric shavers, most of them Norelco. For example, I also have a 7810XL. What I really like about the 7310 is compared to other designs, I don't accidentally press the head release button while the back of my head which is a huge problem with the 7810XL. There's no way to foresee this detail just by looking at the two models which are more or less identical.",A2WHCYK6J8MKZ5,4.666666666666667,5.0,4.0
Philips Norelco 7340 Men's Shaving System packaging may vary,3.0,"I've been using these Norelco shavers for years.  They last 3-5 years and then I get a new one; method of death typically involves worn out battery or getting smashed in a fall to the floor.  This is the latest one that I bought a couple weeks ago, and I've been the least satisfied with it so far.

First, it lacks a ""needs charge"" indicator.  While it appears to have two LEDs on the front, which I took to mean one LED for ""charging/charged"", and one for ""needs/low charge"", it's really just one indicator made to look like two.  An unfortunate related problem:  Norelco describes the ""needs charge"" or ""low charge"" indication simply as a ""charge indicator""; hey Norelco, that's insufficient English, because it could be taken to mean ""chargING indicator"".  When I was looking at buying one of these, I didn't realize that ""charge indicator"" in the description meant what it actually means.

Second, Norelco's descriptions of their shavers no longer tell you what kind of battery is inside.  Is it NiCd or NiMH?  Which one matters because you can run a NiCd battery all the way down without problems, but if you do so to a NiMH you are actually damaging it.  Repeated deep discharges of NiMH will kill it.  For that reason I actually prefer the older NiCd batteries because I can run them all the way down, and don't care about the quicker charge feature of NiMH batteries.  The only indication that it's probably a NiCd is that the manual says ""battery performance is best if you recharge only when the batteries are (almost) completely empty.""  Here's hoping.

All that said, I may very well keep this shaver.  I'm on the fence and trying to give it a chance.",A2DG9F8YOXNY7Y,3.0,3.0,4.0

"Alterna Hemp Organics Texturizing Glaze, 5.1-Ounce Tube",5.0,"I have been looking for a curling product that would keep the curl in my hair, but not cause my hair to be crunchy or frizzy.  Well, I have finally found it!  This is now one of my ""must have"" products, along with several others that I never deviate from.

Gels leave my hair crunchy, and so do most mousses.  Not only that, but they make the curls clump together which makes my very fine hair look horribly thin and wet.  Then, if I try to fluff it or brush it out, my hair becomes frizzy and it loses the curl.

Alterna Texturing Glaze makes my hair soft, not crunchy, and it leaves it full.  It is so hard to explain, because I didn't believe it based on what the other reviews were saying.  But I got a gift certificate that I was able to use so I thought I would give it a try.  I have wavy, fine, thin hair, and this stuff just keeps the wave in it while taking away any frizz.  It almost looks like I have a nice perm that I don't have to use styling products to enhance it (if that makes sense).  When I touch my hair, it feels like I don't have any product in it.

I put this glaze on while my hair is wet, just before I blow dry it.  I use about 1/2 teaspoon and I work it through all of my hair.  After I am done blow drying it, I spray it with hairspray and I am good to go.

I am so glad I gave this stuff a try, because it is what I have been looking for for years.  I was constantly trying a different gel or mousse but they all did the same thing.  Now, I don't have to look any further!",A3OC93X866Z8TB,5.0,5.0,4.0

Philips Norelco Speed-XL 8240 Men's Shaving System,5.0,"A great razor without a lot of bells and whistles. Why pay 2 or 3 times more for, basically, the same razor with a few more lights? I agree that a low battery light would have been nice, but this isn't a big deal since the battery lasts a long time and can be charged in 1 hour. Plus, if you don't have an hour to wait around a quick 5 minute charge will get the job done (or you can use it corded.)

Now, as far as the shave goes it gives a very close shave with no irritation. It is a little faster than previous models but don't expect to cut your shaving time in half. I tried a foil razor once and it left a few stray hairs here and there which it refused to pick up no matter how hard I tried to get them. I switched to a rotary and I haven't had that problem since. I switched to electric razors a few years ago when my face just couldn't handle blades anymore; I thought I'd have to sacrifice the closeness of a blade for a healthier face but this hasn't been the case with Norelco, they have consistently given me blade close shaves.

I've had this razor for about 6 months now and couldn't be happier. I've read the reviews on the Arcitec and, honestly, can't see a good reason why I should pay 2 or 3 times for it when this one works so wonderfully.",A2UHXPMDDHRFC9,4.6,5.0,4.0
Philips Norelco Speed-XL 8240 Men's Shaving System,5.0,"I bought the 8240XL for my Dad for Fathers Day and he loves it!!! It gives him a close comfortable shave.  I own the 8260XL and the reason I did not get him that model is because I knew he would not use the Jet Clean System.  This razor is very good for my Dad, but as for me it's a different story!  I collect Norelco Electric Razors.  I have the Spectra James Bond Razor, the Smart Touch XL with the minute display, and the Arcitec 1050cc with the Jet Clean System, and the 8260XL with the Jet Clean System.  Now which one shaves the best?  First, unlike my Dad, I have a heavy dark beard and I have to shave every morning and sometimes in the afternoon to keep from getting a shadow.  For me, all of these razors shave ok, just ok, never as close as a blade!, but the best of these razors are the Spectra James Bond Razor and the Smart Touch XL.  These two razors shave pretty close.  The 8200 series is ok, and I will leave it at that.  The razors in the 8200 series  are all pretty much the same except as you move up the line you get more bells and whistles. All the razors in the 8200 series shave the same.  I shave with the Arcitec 1050cc and the 8260XL and rotate between the two. At present, they are doing a pretty good job, but sometimes I  bring my other razors out of retirement.  I like to use Mennen Afta Pre Electric Loation and a little talc powder which helps me to achieve a close comfortable shave. Williams Lectric Shave is too greasey.  After shaving, I put on a little Mennen Afta After Shave Skin Conditioner or Nivea Post Shave Balm which helps my skin from becoming dry. I do not get razor burn from any of these electric razors. I do like the Jet Clean System that came with my Arcitec 1050cc and 8260XL.  I always wash out my razors before I use them in the cleaning system which helps to save on the cleaning solution.  The cleaning solution last about a month and it can be purchased at Walmart or you can have it delivered right to your door every month by purchasing it from Amazon. Norelco has been a trad in my family for years.  My Dad, Grandfathers and Great Grandfathers all shaved with Norelco Electric Razors.  I'm 47 and I have been shaving with them for the most part since I started shaving.  I have had problems with Norelco though.  There have been times when a relatively new Norelco Razor would just quit on me, but I am happy to say that Philips Norelco ALWAYS replaced the defective razor!  If you want to get a close comfortable shave stick with Norelco.  Shaving with Norelco Electric Razors is better then the mess of soap and water and you don't have to buy blades and shaving cream all the time.-Michael",A2BVRKJ12P1HDY,4.6,5.0,4.0
Philips Norelco Speed-XL 8240 Men's Shaving System,4.0,"I recently received this product and am very satisfied!!  We decided that I would shave my Hubby's face (he was very scared but allowed me nonetheless).

The good points:
1. Unlike our older Norelco circa 2003, everything is ONE uniform piece.  The other shaver had soooo many pieces to keep track of that it became cumbersome.

2. The shaver head contours and flexes to the shape of your face and neck.  Anyone who shaves regularly knows how difficult it can be to get every little hair.  This system provides a clean, smooth shave.

3. On the back of the shaver there is a button that when pressed a small tripper conveniently pops up.  We used the trimmer to trim his sideburns and mustache.  VERY USEFUL... opposed to looking for that little scissor.

4. Quick charge; right out of the box only charged for one hour and we were able to shave his face.  About 15-20 minutes of use.

5. EXTREMELY EASY clean up of the head.  Just push a button, the head opens and you run under the water.

6. Also comes with a nice little brush to use pre-wash for clean-up of the excess hair.  Not for your face, but for the trimmer and shaver head.

The not so bad...
1.  The reason it is missing a star is because I miss how my old Norelco had a little compartment for the Nivea shaving gel/lotion.  The trimmer takes the place of that slot.. so it is worth it even though I miss that cream.

Would highly recommend at a great price!!  We are loving this Norelco.

Edit to add that my husband has sensitive skin and even when he would use all those shaving creams, regular blades, quadruple blades and even my Intuition razor; this one did not cause any sort of a break out or bumps.  We shaved him dry... that is great!",A30Z0GG96D11EO,4.6,4.0,4.0
Philips Norelco Speed-XL 8240 Men's Shaving System,4.0,"I just received this razor as an upgrade to the Philips Norelco 7110X which I had been using for the past 19 months.  While one would expect this razor to perform better given its list price (approximately double what the 7110X is currently), I was frankly surprised by how much better it is in almost every regard.

I previously reviewed the 7110X, so if you want to see what I found lacking in that razor the review is available under that product listing.  As to the superior qualities of the 8240XL, they are:

1.  Shaves are closer and do not require as many passes over the same area.  I still don't think it gives me as good of a shave as a manual razor and shaving cream, but I've never found an electric shaver that could compete with a manual razor in terms of closeness of shave.  Sometimes I prefer the convenience of the electric shaver, however, so that's why I use both methods on occasion.

2.  Feels more solid in the hand.

3.  While it isn't quiet, it sounds less annoying when it's running.

The only serious problem I've encountered so far is with respect to charging the razor.  The manual indicates it may take 12 hours to fully charge the razor before the first use.  I had mine plugged in for over 15 hours and the light on the razor indicated that it was not yet fully charged.  I decided to keep the razor plugged in and use it.  After I completed shaving, the charging light briefly indicated it was fully charged but then started indicating it was still charging again.  I decided to unplug the razor anyway.  I re-checked the manual.  Unfortunately, it's written to cover three different models, so not everything in the manual pertains to this specific model.  Even so, the drawings indicate charging lights on the razor that simply don't correspond to what's on the actual unit (for example, I don't see anywhere on the unit that the word ""Full"" would illuminate), and there's no indication in the manual that these drawings only pertain to other units.  Strange.

Before owning my Philips Norelco 7110X, I had also owned another Norelco model (more similar in quality to this razor than the 7110X) and some other models from Braun.  I've generally been pleased with Norelco electric razors, and this one is another winner.",A2TO2BN3P4C00L,4.6,4.0,4.0

It seems my face needs the combination of tree tree oil and triclosan in a facial soap in order to behave in a manageable way - meaning not break out every 2 days. Once I did the research on triclosan I was suitably cautioned as well as kind of confused: if this triclosan is so awful why is it the number one ingredient of anti microbial, antiseptic hand washes in hospitals? OK, maybe it need not be added to mouthwash and maybe it really should be kept away from small children and babies but you can't just take it away and not replace it with something as equally effective! That is what the ""Greenies"" and the ""It Causes Cancer!"" throngs have effectively done, I guess.

This result-delay is probably not a CLEAN & CLEAR problem.  For some reason our teen boy thought he should use this cleanser  without a washcloth... AND apparently a washcloth is an extremely important part of getting the upper hand on breakouts.

The Backstory
Our boy is 14 and is having to begin shaving several times a week. (Somehow it doesn't seem right that our baby is shaving. sigh.)  This shaving is aggravating his breakouts taking them up a level.  We got this Clean & Clear Cleanser to see what results we could get with an over the counter product.  After a week and a half there wasn't (initially) enough improvement so we made an appointment with a dermatologist.

We've since CANCELLED that appointment because I happened to watch boy wash his face one night. No Wash Cloth.  I smacked my forehead and took the time to show him how to properly wash his face.  Apparently this is a thing guys don't all know.  It's been a week since the demonstration (which included a mention that you don't scrub your face fiercely. That the skin there is delicate, particularly under the eyes....)  and his face is looking really good.  I suspect in another few days even the small spots will be gone.

SUMMING IT  UP
This is working for us.  If you've got  younger teen using it, I highly recommend making sure that they know what they should be doing.  Don't assume they read the directions, even if they read everything else that crosses their path.

Indigo Wild Zum Bag Frankincense &amp; Myrrh,5.0,"I love this kit! You get lots of different types of product to try:

Zum Oil - use for massage or I used all over after I got out of the shower before bed. It is oil but I didn't feel greasy. I like it better than baby oil that I've used sometimes in the past.

Zum Mist - Use this on yourself or spray your bed linens with it. So relaxing. The scent is somewhat subtle - that's not to say you can hardly smell it. It smells strong enough but not so strong that it's overwhelming like some mists I've used.

Zum Wash - I thought it lathered well and it didn't strip my skin.

Zum Body - It's lotion and you get 2 plump pillow packages of it. There's enough in each pack to do your hands, feet, elbows and knees. Love it!

Zum Bar - you get two fairly good sized bars. I imagine they'll last at least a few months depending on how often you use them. I really like this soap. I wash my hands a lot and this soap doesn't feel like it'll make my hands too dry and you can't feel a coating when you rinse. It feels like your hands are clean but they have a lovely scent to them that lasts for awhile. Note that right after washing my hands I was eating some cherries and though I could smell the scent a little, I couldn't taste it at all so even though it does scent your hands a bit, it's not so much that you'll end up transferring the scent/taste to food you might handle after. Just make sure you rinse well.

Zum Rub - I thought the scent of this was a little less than the other products but the balm really softened the heels of my feet. I use it along with a pair of heel socks and I wake up in the morning with soft heels and no cracks. Plus it comes in this adorable little tin that you could re-use after the Zum rub is gone.

I like this kit so much I can hardly wait to try the laundry detergent and I'm sure I'll be buying more of most of these products.",A19SDJ2TSSL8HI,5.0,5.0,4.0

I like the idea of less mess but the pump takes a little more push power than you would expect at first. Not a big deal.

This toothpaste is great for the enamel as the toothpaste can make the weak areas strong and also it works on plaque buildup.

The label comes off so you can see all of the information wrapped around the tube and without the label, you can see how much is left. I also like the fact that it has a plastic cap on top that you can keep on it when not in use. There is a small area where the toothpaste comes out and that protect the area if you accidentally drop it on the floor.

It does not have whitening properties, which is the only reason I deducted a star.

I just hate the waxy feeling of standard dental floss, but Glide is so much smoother.  (I am reminded of this every now and then when I run out of Glide and have to use free floss samples from the dentist until I can run to the store to restock.)

I started using Glide floss when I got braces (had them from age 25-28!).  I got tired of shredding floss on all the little wires, brackets, etc., and then trying to have to get it unstuck.  Glide wasn't 100% shred proof, but it outperformed any other floss I tried, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with dental work to maneuver around (I had a wire glued to the back of my bottom teeth after my braces were removed, so I am stuck with a minor amount of dental work for life).

1) I don't want it to shred
2) I don't want it to be stuck between my teeth
3) I want it to do the cleaning
4) I don't want the flavoring on the floss to be too noticeable

I have tried a number of different floss, and keep coming back to Glide Floss simply because it works the best.  It feels good on my teeth and my fingers holding the floss. It never breaks when I use it.  It never shreds, it glides easily between my (tightly packed) teeth. You can do the cleaning in one pass, it digs out whatever happen to be stuck in there very well. With other floss I feel I need to make a second pass sometimes, but not with Glide.

Flavor: Glide comes in two packaging. Photo attached. One has silver packaging and one has greenish packaging. The silver packaging has no mint flavor, the greenish package has mint flavor (not terribly strong but noticeable). The describe of the package for silver package mentioned ""deep protection"" and for green package mentions ""multi-protection"". I don't feel or see the difference between the two other than one has flavor and the other one does not. I did not notice the mint flavor mentioned on the package. I have a slight preference for no flavor, so if I knew I would have picked the silver package.

In term of price Glide is a little pricier than other floss. To me it is worth it. The best price on this 6 packs I found at Costco, especially when they run a coupon in their flyer. Amazon price is is decent, but fluctuates. I found a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate alert emails when the price reaches the desired price. If you enter ""price history alert"" in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool to be very helpful.

Coincidence or not? I noticed that when I use my Glide floss my hygienist compliments me on my flossing!

"Secret Smooth effects, Unscented, 2.6-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)",3.0,"I bought this at the store because there was a sticker on the package that stated that the product would ""soothe skin after shaving"". I usually don't put anything under my arms right after I shave because most products sting. However, I tried this. It didn't soothe my armpits or soften the skin any, but it did not sting either. I also liked that none chipped off on my clothing.

It goes on creamy and takes a moment to dry. After that it stays on well. Does not seem to soothe or condition, but does not irritate the skin. Not too bad.",A2X3L31KCXBHCL,3.0,3.0,4.0

"Oral-B  Glide Floss, Mint , 54.6 yd (Pack of 4)",4.0,"It was time to buy floss again and I never know what to get. The store I was at had only two types. One was Oral B Glide Mint Floss (54.6 yards) and that's what I bought. I'm burdened with large hands and a small mouth. It's a bad combination for flossing. At least a decade ago, perhaps a lot longer, a dentist showed me a trick. He said to pull out about eight inches of floss and then tie the two cut ends together to make a loop. Then he said I could control the loop by using only the tips of two fingers on each hand. I found, by experimenting, that you had  to tie the two ends tightly  enough that they wouldn't pull apart under stress. That's really worked well and I've been flossing that way  ever since. This new floss seems to work well. Another problem I have is that some of my teeth are very close together and it can be a problem to floss them. Well, this floss seems to work better  than most. I wouldn't regard it as the best floss I've used, but it does a reasonably good job and is easy for me to use.

"Gillette Razor Power, Fusion Gamer, 1-Count Package",4.0,"When I told Mike that he was going to try the Gillette Razor Power, Fusion Gamer, he just laughed. ""Why would a gamer need a special razor?"", he asked. Imagine our surprise when we realized you actually hooked the razor up to a game controller and shaved your face that way! Okay, not really. But it does take a battery, which is kind of weird. I waited excitedly. Mike has a very full beard and doesn't shave daily. He's more of a clean-up every now and then kind of guy. I waited...waited....waited...until the day came! So I excitedly asked about the razor.
""It was fine"", he said.
""Was the vibration weird"", I asked.
""I could hardly feel it"", he answered.
""Well, did you like it"", I retorted.
""I mean, it worked fine. It was just as good as any other razor I've used. But I still can't figure out what makes it specifically for a gamer...."" he said.
At that point, I gave up on getting more information out of him. So there you have it, The Gillette Razor Power, Fusion Gamer.....""just as good as any other razor"".

Oral-B Indicator Contour Clean Soft Toothbrush 4 Count,5.0,"Well I spotted the Oral-B Indicator Toothbrushes on sale in a local store and decided to try them out. And was happy to see that they are rated the SOFT type of bristles. Well I began brushing with these toothbrushes and was somewhat taken back the first time that I brushed as these are NOT SOFT bristles, they are MEDIUM bristles. However, I am finding that two weeks later, and even brushing over 2 minutes, my very fussy gums DO NOT BLEED. And I find that my teeth and gums feel very clean. Very happy about this as I have very fussy gums (sensitive) and they have responded well to my using this toothbrush. Below I will share how I use this toothbrush on my very finicky gums...

How I brush with this toothbrush: I brush (twice a day or more) for 2 to 3 minutes, however, I do not press down too hard with this toothbrush, press down too hard on the gums can cause irritation I found. What I find is the most helpful is brushing at moderate pressure for 2 to 3 minutes. Then I use a antiseptic rinse and my teeth, mouth and gums are good to go for hours.
Also I brush at night before bedtime (and sometimes after lunch), so this toothbrush gets a great workout. Even brushing as often (and long) as I do, I have no problems with this toothbrush  and it is great quality and I believe it will last longer than the cheap generic types of toothbrushes do.

Unfortunately, it didn't work the way I had hoped.  While the dried blossoms are amusing to play with, as dried herbs often are, they are not exactly pretty compared to flower petal potpourri. It's also sad that the bag is not designed to be resealed. If you're careful you may be able to use the original sticky seal, but you have to be very careful opening and closing the bag.

Pre de Provence Maison French Dried Lavender Blossoms for Fragrance,5.0,"Note: At the time of this review, seven different products are being sold on the same page. I am reviewing the lavendar lavender blossoms.

This is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

When you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

If there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it.",A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,4.088888888888889,5.0,4.0

Pre de Provence Maison French Dried Lavender Blossoms for Fragrance,2.0,"I use essential oils frequently in atomizers, on damp cloths near fans, and even as an additive in homemade cleaners. What I've found is that lavender scents can be tricky. Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent.

I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms.",A33PVCHCQ2BTN0,4.088888888888889,3.0,4.0

The fact that you want to add more to the bath is also a problem. I didn't find that the scent stayed. And the aromatherapy is a HUGE part of this product. It smelled nice and strong in the bottle, but faded fast. I just added a bit more of my own lavender oil.

I'm a bath snob in the long run. I want a product that is going to last in scent and make my skin feel nice. This just did not do that. So only three stars.",A2TDWDE3ZSSCA1,4.088888888888889,3.0,4.0
Pre de Provence Maison French Dried Lavender Blossoms for Fragrance,5.0,"Dried Lavender Blossoms? Amazing! If I had known that you could buy these, I would have purchased them a long time ago. We love the smell of lavender in our house. It is probably the top scent that we buy in all candles, waxes, etc. My original plan was to use this like potpourri. When the bag arrived and we smelled it, we had the brilliant idea to put it in our scent warmer (ceramic warmer that is warmed by an electronic light). It worked out so well! Our house smells like lavender and it is amazing.

These dried lavender blossoms are very potent too. We only used about half a handful. So, we still have almost the entire bag to use for later. It will last for a long time. These would also be great for making clothing bags. If you place a little bit in a cheesecloth type bag and place it in your drawers, it makes your drawer and the items inside smell incredible. I like to use them in my sock and underwear drawers.

These lavender blossoms are high quality and will last for a long time. I highly recommend them if you want your house to smell like lavender.",A39WWMBA0299ZF,4.088888888888889,5.0,4.0

Pre de Provence Maison French Dried Lavender Blossoms for Fragrance,5.0,"I can remember watching my grandma iron clothes. She used a lavender scented spray, and sometimes starch. The clothes also usually smelled of the fresh outside as we hung our clothes on a line. She would let me spray and iron the hankies and pillow cases. To this day the scent of lavender brings back such happy memories.

The Pre De Provence lavender spray smells fabulous. Not the least bit musty, which some lavender sprays can get a bit of a musty undertone, not this one. It's fresh and clean and brightens the entire room. I iron clothes inside out if I'm going to use any spray, and a light spritz left a wonderful fragrance, not overwhelming, and didn't stain my clothes. I would suggest trying a small out of the way place first.

The spray is also good for just refreshing laundry. Getting out winter clothes from storage that are perfectly clean but could just a use a little pick me up after storage.

also very nice spritzed lightly on the bed a half hour or so before going to bed leaves a clean, lavender sleep experience.

Pre de Provence Maison French Dried Lavender Blossoms for Fragrance,5.0,"I never considered a scented water for ironing or steaming my clothes until I saw this product.  What a great idea!  I added this to my garment steamer as well as my steam iron and both impart a lively French Lavender scent that remains long enough to get noticed.  My bottle did not come with a sprayer but I guess this would be another way to use the product:  spritz over fabrics like couches, beds linens.

One thing that was odd about this is the lid was on rather loosely with no safety seal.  Some of the product had leaked into its inner shipping poly bag.  Perhaps a safety seal would eliminate this from happening as well as add a modicum of safety.

In terms of potency, the product I received for this review has a very noticeable lavender scent.  It does not appear weak or understated at all.  Since others have had this concern, it does make me wonder about the company's QC.

Lavender salts are fragrant salts that you pour into your bathwater when the bathtub is filling with water.  They relax you, and help to ease tensions with their floral fragrances.

These bath salts are quite potent.  A little bit goes a long way, as the scent is pungent.

Pamper yourself after a long day by adding these to your bath.  Relax and inhale the beautiful fragrance of lavender.

These also work well when incorporated into sachets.

It had served me well for literally years, but you're really not supposed to keep makeup for years.  I went looking for the same item as a replacement and couldn't find it, so I just bought another Cover Girl concealer stick.

This is basically the same product I loved so much before.  Whether it's identical, or whether all Cover Girl concealer sticks are similar, I can't say.  What I do know is that it works very well for me.  I mostly use it to cover up breakouts and it is really good at minimizing redness while blending in to my foundation (I use a Neutrogena liquid foundation).  This shade (fair, 705) is actually a reasonable match for my skin tone, so sometimes I use this with no foundation.  I can put finishing powder over this and my concealer and you can hardly tell the difference between where the concealer is and the rest of my skin.

This does not irritate my skin and it lasts all day (with foundation).  I rarely rave over drugstore brand cosmetics, but this is one product that really works for me.  It's my ""go to"" heavy-duty concealer.

"Avalon Grapefruit and Geranium Smoothing Shampoo, 11 Ounce",5.0,"Tried it once before I tossed it...and now it's the only one I use.

I have very dry skin and make up crepes under my eyes as a result.  Yes, I've tried many other creams (specifically, every one olay has ever come out with); I've also tried setting it with different powders after watching youtube videos.  For me, powder was the worst choice.

Since most beauty products cater to oily or combination skin,  I imagine that those of us with truly dry skin are more of a minority and so it's reasonable that this won't work for a lot of people.

But if you're like me and you could probably cover your face in olive oil and think, ""damn, now my skin looks nice"", this might be for you.  It is truly the only thing I've used that doesn't make my concealer or foundation crepe.

One reviewer compared it to Vaseline, which it is definitely not.  However, I can see where she was coming from.  It's thick and oily and just what my skin needs.  It also lasts longer than any dermatologist would recommend keeping it for.  I finally threw my first jar out after 6 months because eyeshadow fell in it, and it still looked almost as full as the first day I bought it.",A1EQRBC7NB1YAN,4.783333333333333,5.0,4.0

"Avalon Grapefruit and Geranium Smoothing Shampoo, 11 Ounce",5.0,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,AY8XPOPF0OVO5,4.783333333333333,5.0,4.0

I'm definitely going to purchase this again. Great shampoo!",A23FCPNAHZDWCZ,4.783333333333333,5.0,4.0

"Avalon Grapefruit and Geranium Smoothing Shampoo, 11 Ounce",5.0,"I like cream shampoos. They harken back, which is sometimes nice, but also a container of cream shampoo tends to go further than a container of liquid shampoo. I landed on this and decided to try it.

What I wasn't expecting was that my hair would feel so wonderfully soft and full after the first wash! It lathered beautifully with just a dab of shampoo, rinsed easily and without being fly-away or unmanageable at all, my hair is really so soft. I'm kinda stunned. (As I always do, I rubbed actual coconut oil on my hands and then ran my hands through my hair before blow-drying. But I've always done that. My hair has never felt this good so it isn't because of the light coconut oil finish.)

This cream doesn't really smell anything like coconut oil, but more like a clean baby -- I don't know why.

To note -- at the time I ordered this I didn't realize it was coming from a company in the UK, where I'm not. They delivered in a timely manner, given that the package was sailing across a very large pond, but I'll look for this product from a US distributor the next time I order.

"Avalon Grapefruit and Geranium Smoothing Shampoo, 11 Ounce",5.0,"I am a diehard bare minerals fan. Every single brush I own is by bare minerals EXCEPT for this one. I've used this brush nearly every day for at least 5 years now and the only reason I can tell its not brand-new is because the words ""Elizabeth Arden"" have worn off. I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

We purchased this cape to use when my wife gives me and my son haircuts.

~PROS~
- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

~CONCLUSION~
This cape has made cutting hair easier as it keeps cut hair off of clothes and contains a lot of hair so it can be dumped into the trash can and shaken out outside.",A62S8THB8S60B,4.783333333333333,5.0,4.0

" Revlon ColorStay Liquid Foundation For Normal/dry Skin, Caramel, 1 Fl Oz ",4.0,"I'm a diehard Revlon Whipped fan because it's so easy to use, very full coverage, and it's one of the only ones I've found that actually carries colors that are more neutral and yellow, as opposed to pinkish or green.

But after two years of steady use, I figured I'd give one of their other foundations a try. So I picked the dry skin formula in the color ""Sand Beige"", because that's the color I was using in the Whipped foundation.

Well, they're entirely different shades despite having the same name. Both swatches displayed are from products sold and fulfilled by Amazon in the past few weeks so I don't think it's an issue with age or authenticity.

Decided I'd give it a shot anyway:
Thin, and easily blended with my real techniques sponge.
Definitely NOT drying. In one of the pictures it looks down right oily, but that might be because of the flash reflecting off the zinc or the fact that I had only just put it on.
Definitely NOT full coverage, or at least not as full coverage as the Whipped. More moderate coverage, but it was easy to build up coverage with an additional application.
The one I received was a pump bottle so it's a lot easier and more sanitary than the jar on the Whipped.
By the end of a work day where I sit mostly behind a desk, it had begun to wear off pretty significantly. The after photo is taken roughly 11 hours after application. ***It's fair to note though that I do touch my chin a lot so it's reasonable that it would wear off.
Also, it looks very obvious in the photo that the texture changed throughout the day. I didn't really notice this looking at it myself or even in a mirror. Could again be the flash, but there were no filters added to any of the photos.

All in all, I do like the way it looks for a least the first few hours and I'll continue to use the bottle when I feel like mixing things up. But I'm still sticking with the Whipped.",A1EQRBC7NB1YAN,4.5,4.0,4.0

5 Concentric circles of plastic = act as a 5 blade ""razor"" but with no sharp edges or blunt sides to risk injury with. More of a ""scraping tool"", if you wish.

1) take shower
2) grab disk and scrape your heels at the END of your shower
3) watch the disk accumulate white clumps of your dead skin cells - just rinse the disk and it's clean again.

Heels are smooth and pretty.  it's crazily effective. Of course, the surface area is made for large sections like heels and soles--this is not for toes or small detail parts of your feet.

Panasonic Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Travel Shaver,4.0,"I never knew Panasonic made such a wonderful shaver until I searched for a hand winding shaver so batter/charger power wouldn't be an issue (that would be a true travel shaver if you had to go camping in the woods for 5 days and you forgot to charge it or bought batteries for it.)

I leave this shaver in my car because some times I would be in a hurry and forget to shave in the morning before I get to work.  It is a very nicely made shaver.  As much as I don't like buying things that are made in China, this one is not bad because of its Panasonic brand.  I am glad I bought the silver even though it cost nearly double compared to the black one.  I wish it had a charger (hence the 4 stars) but I guess you can always buy AA batteries if you really had an emergency.
The case is nicely polished like a space pod.  It gives a very close shave.
What I also don't like about is the noise.  It is quite loud (compared to my other bigger Norelco.)
But for $25, this is way beyond a budget shaver.  If you are looking for a travel shaver or something to put in your car, look no further.
A plus is that it is a wet/dry shaver. You can shave in the shower if you want to.",A2JMJVNTBL7K7E,4.0,4.0,4.0

"Braun bodyCruzer Men's Body Groomer, Titanium",4.0,"The Good:

*Decent dry shaver/trimmer that will trim the hair all the way to the stub.
*Adjustable heads for trimming to the desired hair lenght.
*Waterproof
*Durable design

The Bad:

*The blade defeats the purpose of the trimmer in many cases.

The Bottom Line:

This is a decent body groomer from Braun considering other choices out there(Norelco.)  This is one example however when a brand tries too hard to beat out their competition.  The dry trimmer is what you can expect from your body trimmer:  Shaves hair close, but not completely off.  So of course you say to yourself ""Well, that's what the Gillette blade is for, right?""  If you think about it, the  number one reason people buy a body groomer like this is because they get irritation while using a blade and here it is, sitting on top of a trimmer.  Therefore, if you are already comfortable using a blade, then there is no reason for you to get this.  For most, if you are getting irritation from a blade, then you will get irritation from using this blade as well.  However, if you rarely get irritations from blades and prefer to use shave/blade combo in the shower/bath, then this could be a good choice for you.  Other things to consider:  One full charge should last you for about 50 minutes.  Overall a decent choice, but certainly not for everyone.",A2PSC7LUNIDEAH,4.0,4.0,4.0

Philips Norelco Speed Electric Razor,5.0,"I've used pretty much every Norelco out there from the top of the line SensoTouch 3D to their bottom of the line 6000 series. For my face, the HQ9 heads on the 8000 series continue to be the best the Norelco has ever produced. The extra row of rings really makes a difference compared with the HQ8 (and lower) heads on the lower models, which have only one ring of slots and holes. The shave is faster, closer and more gentle. I also find them to be preferable to the HQ10 heads on the Arcitec line (which I believe is no longer produced).

To get as good a shave (and a bit of a better shave on the neck and jaw line) you have to go to the RQ12 heads for the SensoTouch 3D. The HQ9 heads are a far better value -- you get 90% of the performance of the RQ12 heads at less than a third of the cost. Oftentimes the price of an entire 8000-series razor with HQ9 heads is less than the cost of just the replacement heads for a SensoTouch 3D.

What you give up with this razor is some build quality. Although these are made in The Netherlands (and not China as are other mid- and lower-end Norelco models) the build quality is still not as good as their higher end models. This is especially seen in the way the combs and cutters are held into place - it's just a thin plastic retainer system rather than a sturdy combination of metal and plastic in the 3D. You'll want to be careful when taking the heads out for cleaning so as not to break the retaining clip.

Other than the head retaining clip, the build quality is decent. Easy to grip even with wet hands. The built-in trimmer is somewhat poor, but it's hard to find a good trimmer on any electric razor. It comes with a stand, but it's only for storage and not charging -- you have to take it out of the stand to charge it.

The other thing you give up with this model is the ability to shave wet. For me that's not a big deal, since I use an electric to save time, and wet shaving takes twice as long as a dry shave. In the summer months when it's humid I'll use some Face Saver (Remington) which makes a dry shave just as comfortable as a wet shave. Should you prefer a wet shave and want to stay with a rotary, take a look at the Norelco AT830. It has RQ8 heads so the dry shave is not as good as this model, but the wet shave is very nice. I'd recommend pretty much any Panasonic if you're looking for a wet shave in a foil shaver.

While you can't wet shave with this, you can clean it under running water. I only take the heads out for a more detailed cleaning about once a month. Otherwise, just pop the top open, run hot water through it, and you're good to go.

Quiet, comfortable, fast, close and cheap. Can't ask for more from a razor. Highly recommend.",A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,5.0,5.0,4.0

Philips Norelco QC5055 Power Hair Clipper,4.0,"I used this hair clipper and gave my close friend a close shave.  The clipper works in that it will cut hair and allows you to maneuver easily because there is no cord.  I don't have to worry about working around the cord and was able to shave my friend's head very easily.  The real seller is that it is cordless.  You won't realize how much of a difference that makes until you use it for the first time.  It's easy to use, and easy to clean.  The clipper is not too small and not too big.  I am 5'6"" and about 200 pounds and it fits in my hand nicely.  You can use the clippers and it's attachments to cut almost any type of hair on almost any part of your body.

If only it were able to handle a more powerful motor/battery for it's design I would give it 5 stars.  Thicker hair might need a bit more juice to make a quicker shave.",A10ZBR6O8S8OCY,4.0,4.0,4.0
Philips Norelco QC5055 Power Hair Clipper,4.0,"My previous trimmers were all corded, but this Philips is cordless (or corded). It uses a NiMH battery pack, which means there's no memory effect and you'll get more than 1 year of use out of it (versus NiCd which is a horrible battery chemistry that some cordless devices still use).

It includes 3 different trimmer guides, 2 of which are fully adjustable. This prevents the need to keep 15 different guides. Unfortunately, the adjustment is difficult to use. I had trouble increasing the depth because of how the thumb button was designed.

The unit itself is very sleek and unique. It comes apart into 2 pieces for easy cleaning. The battery pack is the bottom half while the upper half houses the motor, transmission, and blades. Unfortunately, the trimmer does not stand upright by itself. It would have come in handy, although I am sure people would do that and it'd fall onto the ground, hence why Philips designed it to lay flat on a table.

The negatives of the trimmer are far and few. The blades are very noisy, and there's no full charge indicator. The LED ring just glows RED to indicate it is charging or fully charged. The trimmer also does not include a pouch.

Overall, it is the right price and offers the same functions as a normal corded Wahl trimmer but without as many guides. The only drawback is that the guides aren't as easy to use.

Pros: NiMH battery pack, simple to clean and use.

Cons: Noisy, trimming guides aren't that easy to use.",AN81JUYW2SL24,4.0,4.0,4.0

If you've never tried it, you won't believe how great it makes your skin feel and look, and this brush is a wonderful tool to start with.
First of all there are slight curves on the handle. This means that whether you grip the brush at the top or closer to the bottom it will be comfortable and not slip around. The bristles look to be natural, and have just the right amount of stiffness for exfoliation. Simply rub on your skin gently so that all of the dead skin flakes off.
Next, I like to get in the shower and use the brush while it's wet to both cleanse and to use the bumpy side to massage my legs and rear.

The other side is bamboo fiber, which is super soft.  It holds all my body wash, maybe too well because I'm not getting quite the number of suds that I expect.

Urban Spa Natural Bamboo and Jute Bath Mitt,3.0,"I usually only use liquid body soap, partly because it's a pain when I drop bar soaps, and unless I have a washcloth the lather isn't as nice. When I saw this exfoliator that firmly holds the soap in place (with Velcro no less), I decided to give it a try.

The holder is a good size and even fits a thick bar of soap. The Velcro closure works very well to firmly keep the soap inside the sleeve. The soft washing side provides a nice bubbly lather. The exfoliating side, however, if pretty rough, even using a soft touch. I really can't use it as it hurts to the point of leaving scratches on my skin. But the most concerning part about this soap envelope, however, is that it doesn't dry between showers, and that doesn't seem sanitary.  On the one hand, it can be washed, but on the other I hate to think of the bacteria forming due to moisture between washes. Even 24 hours after my last shower, it's still wet (not merely damp). All in all, this is handy for those who prefer bar soap, but it's not good enough to make me switch full time from liquid body wash.",A39H1GO9E3YQIB,3.5,3.0,4.0
Urban Spa Natural Bamboo and Jute Bath Mitt,2.0,"You are supposed to put your bath soap in the pouch and close it with the velcro. There is a soft side and a rougher bamboo side that you can wash and exfoliate your body with. There is also a small loop that you can use to hang the mitt up with to dry and store.

The issue I have with this mitt is the design does not make for ease of use. Once you put a bar of soap in it, it becomes very bulky to use in the shower or tub. A better design would have been to have a strap across the mitt so you can slide your hand in. It would've made it much easier to hold.

Beyond the design issue is the real problem - the quality. If you look at the pictures you can see the velcro is not properly sewn onto the mitt. Also the edges that are sewn are not straight,even or complete. There are frayed edges which means this mitt will not last long at all.

This is too bad because I like the idea of of a bamboo mitt - it's just this is not the quality  seek.",A1WF3V89I4E8BR,3.5,2.0,4.0
Urban Spa Natural Bamboo and Jute Bath Mitt,4.0,"&nbsp;If you want a natural fiber bath mitt for the at-home spa experience, this offering from Urban Spa is a good choice. The bamboo side is just rough enough to exfoliate without feeling like you are scouring your skin, and the jute side is soft and has a ""polishing"" effect. Both sudz up nicely with body wash and should work well with salt or sugar scrubs as well. It is easy to slip on and has a handy loop for hanging and drying in the shower.

The natural bamboo and jute mitt is a little small on my hand (6ft tall man) but it works. It should be fine on smaller hands. I'm a hairy guy and some of my body hair does attach itself to the mitt even after thoroughly rinsing and wringing out. That doesn't bother me, but it might limit shareablity with my wife. I also worry that over time it might get a musty smell since it takes a while to dry, but as long as I keep using it with soap, I hope that it won't be an issue.

Urban Spa Natural Bamboo and Jute Bath Mitt,3.0,"Obviously, cellulite is not affected by a brush. Simple biology reveals the massive flaws in this idea. If what one is truly seeking is to improve cellulite, one wants a cellulite creme with caffeine OR with any form of retinoid. Or a plastic surgeon. This whole topic was just explored on an episode of The Doctors.

However, let's talk about what this brush is great for: exfoliating! One can do a light dry rub before a shower or a lighter rub during the shower (be careful, wet skin is more delicate). This will keep skin youthful if one follows up with a light moisturizer.

The brush is well-made, looks nice, and has held up well this week (it appears brand new even though it is hanging in my shower).

I like that it's big because you can file the rough spots off your feet faster with less work.  One side is slightly convex and is good to get to certain spots, and the other side is slightly concave which makes it easy to get the entire bottom of your heel sanded.  It's solid bamboo and does not flex like my smaller plastic one does.  The abrasive is the same on both sides and really grinds the dead skin off.  I wear flip flops a lot during the summer and something about them makes my heels get really dry and rough so a tool like this is very, very useful.  I love lying on my back on the sofa while the family and I are watching T.V. and sand on my heels.

Kate Somerville&nbsp;ExfoliKate Intensive&nbsp;Exfoliating Treatment&nbsp;(5 Fl. Oz. Luxury Size),5.0,"I got this in a beauty subscription box.  I've had it for so long I forget which box.  I needed a new exfoliator so I grabbed this from my stash.

Here are the ingredients, since listing them provides a good introduction to the product:

Water, Lactic Acid, Polyethylene, Soybean Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pectin, Papaya Fruit, Lactobacillus Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Ceteareth-20, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dehydroxanthan Gum, PEG-100 Stearate, Salicylic Acid, SD Alcohol 40-B, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Sorbic Acid, Cinnamomum Cassia Leaf Oil, Honey, Acetic Acid, Lavender Oil, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bromelain, Papain, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Phenoxyethanol, Geranium Maculatum Oil, Rosewood Wood Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Orange Oil, Linalool, Limonene, Cinnamal, Beta-Carotene (CI 75130), Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex (CI 75810).

This is basically a chemical and physical exfoliator in one.  It has lactic acid, papaya fruit, pumpkin extract, bromelain (digestive enzyme from pineapple), and papain (digestive enzyme from papaya).  I have seen all of these in peels before.  These ingredients are why you leave this on the face for one or two minutes after scrubbing with this product -- to give the ""peel"" portion time to do its work.

It also has some kind of grit in it.  I'm not sure what the grit is, but it works as a physical exfoliator.

This has a couple of other things that will especially help oily or acne-prone skin: salicylic acid, honey (has antibacterial properties), and retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).  Because of all the peeling ingredients and such, you will really want to use a good SPF product while you are using this to avoid sun damage.

This may make your skin more sensitive than usual.  I am a longtime exfoliator on a daily or every other day basis, so while I do get some tingling when I use this (usually every other day since this is a bit stronger than the sorts of things I normally use), it doesn't last -- once I wash the product off, the sensation goes away.  If you have sensitive skin, you will want to be super careful.  Maybe do a patch test first.  I think the tingling might be from the cinnamon; I have definitely had reactions to cinnamon oil in the past that turned my skin red, although it seems to be at a low enough level here that it is not doing that.

This is a green color, I'm guessing from the chlorophyll/copper complex.  It has the texture of a clay mask, maybe a bit thinner (easier to spread around on the face and rub in), and I can't quite place the smell, although this does have a lot of plant oils and extracts and I guess the scent is just a combination of those.  Maybe something citrusy but there are also some floral notes in there.

I personally don't find this drying.  I think the concentration of the grit/solids/beads is just about right as I can actually feel them moving over my face (some exfoliators don't have enough exfoliating particles to be worth it, but this is not one of those).  It washes off cleanly and has not caused any irritation to my skin.  I do think I am getting good results -- existing breakouts are clearing up faster than usual (this is really the only change in my routine) and I'm not getting new ones, even though I am using facial oils.  (I can only use facial oils if I am also using a good exfoliator.)

I do use kind of a lot of this at once.  I could probably get by with less and actually need to learn to get by with less because this is a pretty expensive product.  But, it works and I am going to dig through my stash (which is huge) to see if I can find more, because I am really liking the results.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,4.75,5.0,4.0
Kate Somerville&nbsp;ExfoliKate Intensive&nbsp;Exfoliating Treatment&nbsp;(5 Fl. Oz. Luxury Size),5.0,"Exfolikate is a great product--sort of a cross between an exfoliating scrub and a mild superficial peel--and it gives instant results, which is more than can be said for a lot of cosmetic products.  I've used Exfolikate for several years, and it *does* live up to the hype and cult-following; you get results after even a single use.

Some people don't like Exfolikate because they think it's too aggressive;  I once heard someone say it should be used for scrubbing bathrooms!!  I think it really depends on how your skin is....and only you know that best.  For me, it works very well--my oily skin doesn't slough off easily, causing skin particles, oil, and hard water in San Francisco to combine into invisible pore-clogging scum.  Exfolikate helps---it removes dead skin to smooth my face and de-gunks my pores so they're (temporarily) less noticeable.  I use it 1-2 times per week, and leave it on for about 3-4 minutes prior to showering.  From personal experience, let me warn you: DO NOT try leaving it on longer because you think you'll get even better results.  I once left it on for 25 minutes, and really regretted it;  it took off too much surface, leaving me with raw skin which kind of dried out/peeled off after a couple of days.  Lesson learned the hard way.

If you use it right, starting conservatively until you know how your skin can handle things, it's a great option.

A friend suggested I give Kate Someville's ExfoliKate a try...I was just a little astonished at the price! Even the samples aren't cheap on ebay (cheaper than on Amazon for the .25 ounce sampler size if you want to give this a whirl before you make a heavy investment.)

Now I can see why! This has to be the fastest and most potent skin care product I've ever tried.

The product comes out as a pretty malachite green, with a nice, fresh smell. You massage it onto clean, wet skin, and the directions said to let it sit for up to two minutes. It feels a little warm, but not unduly so; there are those little microbeads so many skin treatments have nowadays.

My skin is hardy, so I let it stay on my skin for five minutes before I rinsed it off.

Wow...just wow! My skin looks phenomenal, and it feels as smooth as a baby's bottom.

I was weighing buying a Clarisonic, but after this treatment, I can't see how my skin could better! I'm going to invest in the big tube - I can see ExfoliKate has earned a permanent place on my beauty treatment shelf.

No lotion is needed after using this body polish. I use it once a week or so, and my skin still feels smooth for a few days. This is a great exfoliant. Fresh products have a superb reputation. I have visited the store in Boston many times, and the pure scents of the products are revitalizing.

I would recommend not using the body polish everyday. As I have stated, using this body polish once a week keeps my skin smooth and soft.

Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual Men's Razor,3.0,"When it has came down to the advances we get with shaving, they can be strong at times with giving us the best and closest shaves, or a hit & miss only after a few times. That does come to be the case with the Gilette Fusion Proglide Manual Razor. I like it because it gives a strong clean cut shave right out of the gate when you use it. My biggest gripe though is that only after a few times because the blades in the cartridge are so thin, the razor does become quickly dull to the edge. So even to the visible eye, you lose that shave and you'd have to earn those wings by quickly getting a refill for your Gilette razor. While it is a great concept, it can be a easier waste of money only after a short time. Hopefully, Gilette can come out with a razor that can be closer to the edge.

Hesh Multani Mati 100gms,5.0,"I highly reccommend this mask to anyone who suffers from oily skin as well as those who have hyperpigmentation and acne.  This is suitable for all ethnicities.  I have been a faithful user of this mask for 3 months.  My skincare routine is very stringent, but I do not have to wear any foundation at all, just lipstick and eyeliner.  Try using this mask powder mixed with rose water to help soften skin.  Other liquids such as green tea, milk, and mineral water will give the skin additional benefits as well.  I use it daily to keep acne away, and it does have a mild lightening effect (which is natural) so over time you will see any hyperpigmentation begin to fade.  My skin is not as oily as it used to be.  Just use less than a teaspoon of the powder mixed with the liquid of your choice, or even plain water, to make a thin paste, or less water to make a thicker mask and apply it to your face and neck.  Leave it on for 15 minutes or until you see that it has dried.  You will notice that your skin feels like it is getting tighter as the mask dries.  Rinse it off with warm water and pat it dry.  If you mix the mask powder with sandalwood, it will also help with discoloration. You may want to use a moisturizer after your mask.  There is no need to wash your face with soap afterward as this will over dry your skin, use your facial scrub weekly when using this mask.

I hope you get great results, definatey give this a try.  In 2-3 weeks you will get results.",A3I3BI5PFL3MSH,5.0,5.0,4.0
"Listerine Total Care Whitening Mouthwash, 6 Benefit Fluoride Anticavity Mouthwash for Stain Removal and Bad Breath, Fresh Mint Flavor, 16 fl. oz",5.0,"I have Radiance braces. If you don't know, these are braces made of polished sapphire. The brackets look like glass on my teeth. They are clear, but different from ceramic braces. The bands used for Radiance braces are specific and they stain VERY  easily. Walking around with yellowed, slightly brown bands for a month between orthodontist visits when they get changed is embarassing. This Listerine Total Care Plus Whitening helps keep the band from staining and/or removes the stains. Even whitening toothpaste does not remove the stains, but this mouthwash does. I use a Waterpik and pour a capful of this Listerine in. It keeps my bands clean and removes staining along the gumline of my teeth. I smoke, so I do get some yellowing. This mouthwash has helped tremendously.

It is not the most pleasant tasting, and it does sort of froth up like peroxide does, but that is how it works and it is worth it. I stopped using it for a month and I could tell a HUGE difference. My orthodontist also noticed that my bands were more discolored than usual. I went back to using this Listerine and the problems were gone.

Gillette Dry Skin Hydrator Body Wash 16 Fl Oz (Pack of 2),2.0,"This Gillette Odor Shield body wash does not clean very well.  It also does not moisturize very well either.  The smell is also among the worst body washes I've ever used.  I can't say that it really shielded odors either, but I am usually not that smelly.

In sum, it just works and feels like a really cheap body wash with an unattractive smell.  Personally, I wouldn't pay more than a dollar for it.  I would rather buy bargain -bin Rain Dance or Suave shampoo (and use as a head-to-toe body wash) which you can typically get for a buck and smells better.

"Secret Antiperspirant and Deodorant for Women, Clinical Strength Soft Solid, Light and Fresh, 1.6 Oz",3.0,"I've had allergic reactions to some Secret deodorants in the past (usually the clear gels), but this appeared to be a different formula so I decided to give it a try.  For the first couple of weeks, it was fine and didn't irritate my sensitive skin.  However, as I got near the end of the deodorant stick, I noticed a rash and areas of dried out skin where I'd been using the deodorant.  I had to stop using it and throw it away.  Two days after stopping it and I'm still waiting for the rash to go away (it is improving, though).

It's getting warmer where I live and I run into a lot of situations during the day that cause me to sweat -- climbing the stairs (8 flights) at work, walking my dog at midday, and getting back in my car after it's been in the sun (the AC is broken).  I've also been doing some pretty intense exercise lately.  And this has been working well for me as both an antiperspirant and a deodorant.  I'm very happy with the strength and effectiveness of this product -- and it lasts all day!

This is a bit more expensive than other deodorants, but it does have a lot of good qualities.  While this didn't end up working for me because of my sensitive skin issues, it was very effective as a deodorant and antiperspirant.

Shima Oil (8oz) Double The Size!,5.0,"LOL...how could so much moisturizing oil dry out someones hair?  When I read that....Pahahahah.  This product is the lightest oil that I've ever had the pleasure of using.  Before I began using this product, I clipped my ends, although they did not need clipping and I started a new routine.  I have the finest of hair and all I do is moisturize my ends first, then all around the edges and then I part down the middle and do both sides and run my fingers from root the end all through the rest. I wait until it all soaks in and then I roll my hair at night.  When I wake up to style it, I run my oiled fingers through it again and it looks so glossy and feels so sleek and smooth, with NO HINT of being greasy what so ever.  It's like magic in a bottle and I don't typically rave over hair oils but I had to defend this one. My goal used to be to make my hair look and feel like silk.  Who knew that their was something better than silk for your hair?

essie Nail Color,5.0,"I'm absolutely smitten with this polish.  I've been a long time fan of Essie.  I love the formula.  It's a bit thinner than most I use which I find makes it easier to apply evenly and with a good topcoat (I'm currently using and loving Seche Vite) and a good base coat (I use Essie) I get a long wear out of my mani.  But what really gets me with this polish is the color.  While I think the picture is pretty true to color, the shimmer is even more pretty in person.  It's a lovely purple with a light teal shimmer that is subtle, but absolutely stunning at the right angle and in the right light.  Paired with the matte finish it reminds me a lot of the look of more indie polishes, but at an affordable price.  I love, love, love this.  The purple feels very fall appropriate but the subtle shimmer is nice for those of us who don't like to go completely neutral and still love a surprising pop of color.",AHN86VFJIJ2JP,3.6666666666666665,5.0,4.0

All other polishes--Square Hue, Opi, Avon, only last a week at the most. So far I think this is a great winter-time color though it's very flat once applied, no shiny or shimmery. Very matte. **Staying power update** It didn't last an entire day. One day of work and one hot bath later, I am missing an 1/8"" of my polish on my big toe.",A3THYM7XMB8B0U,3.6666666666666665,3.0,4.0

Basically dove grey with a purple hue. A very fall-friendly shade. However Essie polish chips on me pretty quickly. Even with a top coat I can get only about a day of wear before it starts to chip.

The Doctor's Brushpicks Toothpicks 15 Pick Re- Fillable Keychain Dispenser (Pack of 6),4.0,I've got at least 14 year old case of 150 piks that are very close to these Doctors brand I actually like much better. They are similar in size and do the same thing thin on one side and with a bit of brush to the other end. Orthodontist gave me a few of these but I like my old package better...don't know if they are still made or perhaps got sold to this maker. Anyway still they are good just not thin enough to work between my tight teeth during brace work. An older brace patient and this is scary about keeping teeth and gums healthy during the process. So these do help and for me work better than wood picks but not as well as some of the others out there. I also love the batter powered Power Flosser it's called I think. It's not a water pik but it's a little battery powered pick that fits between your teeth along the gum line...they however do not do much for the upper teeth areas which floss does better if you can figure out how to pull it off. I've got rins on back teeth molars and that prevents any flossing there so these help reach areas in the back of teeth that even the water pik does not work well and the battery flosser can't quite reach well either with the braces in my teeth. I bought these knowing in advance what they were and that they weren't quite as nice as my orginal ones but wanted the cases. I bought 6 cases for what 2 individual ones were selling for a that time on Amazon...so no choice of colors but fine. I also note if you refill from bottom hole instead of pulling off the top they last longer and less chance of breaking them too. So that's what I do. Also I could get about 4-5 more piks into the cases without having them stop up because there was too many also. I do like it when there is a case to carry these kinds of things about. So like the case and wish the picks themselves were a lot thinner on the thin end. I have very tight teeth. Also lose the teeth on the other end because all they do is grab my braces when I try to use them. Total waste of time and energy and spoil the mission or purpose of use.,A19MMYMZO363KM,4.0,4.0,4.0

"Opalpix 32ct., 6 packs 192 total picks",5.0,I have very tight teeth. Dental floss is difficult and dentists split dental floss and even those plastic strips they use to help form materials on a tooth from getting on the teeth next to them...those will be demolished over and over before eventually they give up and turn to something else or manage to finally get a strip in between my teeth. Anyway at over 60 I'm  having some orthodontal work done and that does mean braces....first I've ever had with them...and my obession with flossing and my great gums I've worried sick about how to maintain that. Along comes these picks and on reviews alone and sight unseen I took a chance. They came today and they are perfect for my needs they are getting between some teeth that no floss could get between. The only bad thing about them is they are so thin it makes them potential sharp edge could cut a gum. I'm prepared to be careful and use them careful to avoid that. But they more than outweigh the dangers that may or may not lurk there. Also they seem to hold up. I can get through a full set of teeth without bending or breaking them usually. And the handly little dispenser is great for travel or handbag. If careful you might use one for several days. And you could probably sanitize them if you choose with mouth wash. Six packs means about six months supply. I'm happy with these..not so happy with the ordeal of braces. But this is going to make it much easier on my mind and stress level while going through it. I've tried some plastic like dental picks similar to tooth picks and tiny brush on one end but they are no where as thin as these. The seller needs to come up with a better picture to show the actual pick...perhaps a black or colored background instead of white on white.,A19MMYMZO363KM,5.0,5.0,4.0

"e.l.f. Matte Lip Color, Praline, 0.05 Ounce",4.0,"I am a big fan of long wearing lip glosses and lipsticks and have been wearing a lot of matte glosses lately. When I saw this lip color from ELF, I decided to try it. It was so inexpressive I had nothing to lose really. I bought the shade Praline not really knowing exactly what color it was. On my lips, it is a light cinnamony shade with a bit of brown. It's subtle. I have rosy lips and this tones the red down and makes my lips look more neutral.

The stick is pointy so you can line your lips first then fill them in. On the other side of the stick is a build in sharpener. I really like that. The color is  creamy without being overly so. It is not a true matte and it doesn't wear like one. It will wear off after a few hours especially if I eat or drink. It does transfer onto glasses and things so it definitely is not like my matte lipglosses. But I like the subtle color and the price as well. I don't mind reapplying the color. My lips look less dry and wrinkly than they do with liquid matte gloss so it's a nice change. It's a long wearing lip pencil. Well, longer wearing that bullet lipsticks anyway.

For the low price I am going with 4 stars. if I paid $20 for this, I would go with 3 because it does transfer and wears off  But the price can't be beat and it feels nice on my lips. Not too heavy and not too dry.",A331BHAR0TRLWT,3.8,4.0,4.0

"e.l.f. Matte Lip Color, Praline, 0.05 Ounce",4.0,"I like wearing bold lip colors and I hadn't tried anything new from e.l.f. for awhile so I added this on to a recent order.  I am mostly happy with it.

If you are worried that it was going to be too bold, you don't need to.  Although this is called ""wine,"" I'd classify it more as a cool red.  (I did need some more cool reds in my collection, so that is OK by me.)  It is not quite as pigmented as the official product image would have you believe.  With a light application and/or blotting, this should work for a lot of people.  Or, you can wear it full strength like I did!

This does come off when you eat and drink so you will need to reapply throughout the day.  However, it is very convenient to reapply.  It is small in size and fits easily in a purse, plus the cap stays on so you don't have to worry about it getting everywhere in your bag.  The tip is good for going around the outline of your lips, and you can kind of use the flat of the side to fill in elsewhere.  I have not had any trouble with bleeding, feathering, or migration, although this would certainly work with a lip liner if that is a concern to you.  (Also, for what it's worth, this isn't a hugely messy product.  I have some lipsticks where if your hair touches your lips even for a second, you end up with streaks of color on your face when you brush it away.  This product does NOT do that.)

For some reason, the outer box says you need to sharpen this with a sharpener.  I guess they didn't read over their template very well before adapting it for a new product.  This actually has a twist-up applicator that works pretty well.  No sharpener needed.  (And it is a good twist-up applicator, not one where you are constantly worried about the product breaking off.)

This is not drying, but it is not the most moisturizing lipstick I've ever tried.  It is kind of middle of the road in that regard, for me.  I will probably be reserving it in the future for times when my lips are in great shape (so, not winter when everything is dry).

In the end, I do like the color, though it is lighter than expected.  This is super easy to apply and convenient to carry around for reapplication purposes.  I wish it was a bit more moisturizing, but I can definitely live with it the way it is.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,3.8,4.0,4.0

LIP INK Shine Moisturizer Organic Vegan Lip Gloss (0.25 fl oz),5.0,"After years and years and YEARS of searching for some sort of SPF product that would keep my lips from burning, I can't believe it's this Lip Ink shine layer that has finally done it for me.  I'd tried every highly touted product; bull frog, white-ish zinc products, lipsticks with high SPF, and inevitably if I was out in the sun all day, my lips would be horribly swollen the next day - the problem (as I assessed it) was that with my mouth slightly open while breathing hard (running around playing frisbee or kadima on the beach), my lower lip caught the sunshine - the angle from above being such that the direct sun would hit on my lower lip right where the dry outer lip transitioned to the wet 'inner' lip where lipstick and lip balm didn't seem to stay on, and I was simply at a loss to find *anything* that would protect that area without immediately wearing off by lip licking or whatever - I mean you know what I'm talking about, we have lips - lipstick doesn't stay on the 'inside' of your mouth.... so I was seriously fearing I'd develop lip cancer and live the last few decades of my life with my lips removed and horribly disfigured (I have a morbid imagination).

So then last year I discovered the lip ink with this lip shine moisturizing top coat (which I love for all day wear) but I was VERY FEARFUL of really putting it to the test and wearing it without any additional sunscreen on my lips - but I was cautiously thrilled when the first attempt of a half day at the beach did not result in any swollen lips.  Then I tried it again and again, on longer days until I was out there from 9am to 6pm in the full on summer sun (reapplying the shine layer whenever I noticed my lips getting dry) and miraculously - this is the first and only product to truly protect my lips, without any hint of burning, tenderness, or swelling the next day.

I find myself wondering how it really works, because it's a 'light' smooth innocuous non-viscous layer, it's not like it's glued on my lips or even waterproof - and yet it really works.  I think if it's possible, maybe there is some protective element that absorbs into the skin so it works even if it wears off temporarily?

I would like to add for anyone with burn-sensitive lips that is going to use this as lip sunscreen, the lip ink COLOR layer does not have any SPF and I had not realized that and wore that by itself without reapplying the clear shine layer and my lips DID BURN.  But after looking up the product info, that is what they do specify - no SPF on the color layer, all the SPF is in the shine layer.  But it is PLENTY effective as long as you keep reapplying.  And if that wasn't great enough - you can look fabulous on the beach with your shiny fresh lip-ink color lips!  I like having an 'excuse' (the SPF) to wear makeup out at the beach :)",A2EWF2OWK60DJW,5.0,5.0,4.0
"NARS Women's Larger Than Life Lip Gloss, Gold Digger",4.0,"It's a shame more colors of this lip gloss aren't available because it is one of my favorites.  I have it in Viva and although it isn't a color I would have normally picked out on my own (it's a rich rose vs. the more neutral mauves I tend to favor) I really, really like it.  It seems more grown up than other shades of pink and I've found it suits my coloring perfectly.  (I have fair skin with a very slight yellow undertone (My pantone color is 1Y05), blonde hair and gray/green eyes and I thought this looked fantastic.)  I especially like wearing it with a smokey eye since it is a little less dramatic and offsets such a bold eye well.

In addition to looking great on, I also enjoy the feel and staying power of this gloss.  It definitely doesn't feel as slippery as other glosses, but is far from sticky.  If I had to describe it's texture I would probably say it's on the thick side and a little tacky.  This works to its advantage because it has good staying power, making it perfect for special events.  It also seems to be somewhat moisturizing, though I would never skip my chapstick and lip primers as I have very, very dry and flaky lips.

Overall I think this is a really lovely gloss and one of my favorites.",AHN86VFJIJ2JP,4.0,4.0,4.0

"Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 70, 3 Fl. oz.",5.0,"I bought the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF70 sun protection prior to a recent trip to Peru and Ecuador during which I expected to be out in the midday sun at high elevation, which amplifies the damaging effect of the sun's rays. I carried it with me every day and applied it liberally to my face, neck, ears and arms - anything that was exposed. Since it was quite hot and humid and I was perspiring a lot, I applied it again later in the day. I managed to avoid any sunburn at all, and since it is nearly unscented, it did not attract mosquitoes or other insects.

I'm so impressed with the sheer, non-greasy, unscented formula that I've started using it as my daily sun protection and will continue to do so throughout the summer. Previously, I would only use a high SPF lotion when I knew I was going to be outdoors for hours - mainly because I do not like the greasy texture and strong scent. I use the SPF lotion along with my other moisture cream and foundation and have had no problems with reddening, rashes, etc. Other reviewers have reported skin sensitivities; as with any other new product that you use, you should indeed test it on a small area prior to slathering it all your face !",A2BAAKZHSUGCDP,4.666666666666667,5.0,4.0

I like trying new products and to be honest my favorite is the oribe super shine and the oil, but I purchased this for my daughter who has frizzy hair and ended up trying this myself, not expecting as much results I get get from oribe .I was wrong this is right up there I was amazed what a few drops of this for my hair which also tends to get frizzy especially  in the humidity. I used this after washing and conditioning  my hair and sprayed a few pumps in my hands and distributed through my hair concentrating more at the ends and less in the front ,just a few tiny dabs because if you use to much you may end up with greasy hair. Took me a few trys before I got this right. This is a light oil on the thicker side not runny like some. This left my hair looking great all through the day  without any frizz. This also left a brilliant shine I didn't have to use any other products with this. Works excellent with heating tools also. So now my daughter and I share this and I swear by this product especially if your hair is dry and frizzy.

I may order a second one as my collection grows. The only caveat is that you should place some cloth on the inside as a barrier between the glass and the jewelry if traveling or moving the box, as the inserts are not glued down and your pieces can hit the glass otherwise.",A2YVATF6ZABDFU,5.0,5.0,4.0

Aquaphor is a more multipurpose ointment. This huge jar will last for ages. It is very thick and slightly yellow. It slathers on and forms a protective coating that keeps out the elements and seals in moisture. I use it for my lips, heels, any new tattoos I get and my husband uses it for his hands at home when he is relaxing. He didn't like the thick feel at first but he saw the improvement and is now using it often. Hand creams couldn't begin to heal his hands. When winter comes (and it's just about here in New York!), I will use this very sparingly on my face when I am out in the snow and cold to keep my skin from getting chapped and windburned.

"Aquaphor Healing Ointment,Advanced Therapy Skin Protectant 14 Ounce ( Pack May Vary )",5.0,"I was introduced to Eucerin Aquaphor cream by my dermatologist after a procedure.  She said the Aquaphor will help my skin heal and it did.  I like the protective rich film it left on my skin and that it is totally unscented.  I have been using Aquaphor since then on regular basis.

I use it for dry and cracked heels and it helps me keep them crack free and pain free. The cream is rich and protective on  my heels but it leave my hands tacky and grease as well.  After spreading it on my heels I need to wash my hands.  It is a small price to pay for having the protective film on my problem areas.

Overall:
1. It is effective
2. It is unscented
3. The effect lasts a fairly long time, I apply it once a day
4. The same cream comes in variety of containers.  I use a big tub at home, and carry a small tube in my purse.

I have been using it for many years. I tried other creams but keep coming back to Eucerin.

Since it took a few days for this to arrive from Amazon, I was using a moisturizer on the burned areas, which wasn't really doing much.  As soon as I started using the Aquaphor, I noticed a big difference in how my skin was healing.

This tub is huge, especially since you only need a tiny bit of this.  I plan on divvying it up into smaller containers so I can keep them around the house.

It seems to have a ton of uses; I've been applying it not only on those patches on my hand, but also on dry areas on my face (a result of using Carac cream to remove pre-cancerous patches also), on my lips, on my heels at night, and also on my cuticles.

Head and Shoulders Green Apple 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo And Conditioner 23.7 F,4.0,"Head and Shoulders is well established as effective in successfully combating dandruff, but I had gave up on using it years ago -- driven away by the harsh unpleasant scent.  This new Head and Shoulders Green Apple scented dandruff shampoo is an improvement.

As always, the active dandruff fighting ingredient is pyrithione zinc, effective and an approved over-the-counter antifungal/antibacterial agent.

As a shampoo product, I found this product to deliver rich, thick lather, rinses clean, and smells great.  The green apple fragrance, by the way, is not sharp or bold, but muted, reasonably pleasant, and you'll not likely notice it unless you intentionallt take a sniff.  I also chose to use a separate (different branded) post-shampoo conditioner.  Afterwards, I was very pleased with my hair - soft and manageable as one expects with a quality shampoo and conditioning.

I don't currently have a dandruff problem, so being a fan of moderation in all things chemical or medicinal, I'll mix in use of this Head and Shoulders for about every other shampooing, or to get the recommended treatment about twice a week.",AW7BIYHXUIZ62,4.0,4.0,4.0
Head and Shoulders Green Apple 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo And Conditioner 23.7 F,5.0,"Nice product - ooh!  Smells nice!  Green Apple! Anti-flake.

I do not have dandruff, but I need a good clarifying shampoo to strip residue from shampoo and conditioner 1X per month.  You get a really nice clean with this product.  Be careful - if you color-treat your hair you may need to just wash quickly and rinse, because it will strip color.  I follow this up with Nexxus Polymedic, and L'Oreal (pink top) tube of color shampoo and conditioner. Once per month, and I leave the conditioner on for about 10 minutes with a cap.  The result is strong, shiny, conditioned and clean hair.

I absolutely love HEAD AND SHOULDERS 2-IN-1 SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER but I'm only lukewarm on this shampoo-only product.  The reason is that I have mid-back length hair and it felt like it was leaving my hair too dry.  And the little broken hairs and those renegade gray hairs definitely felt like they had free rein to stick up.  The Head and Shoulders 2in1 product left my hair feeling and looking much better.

This product was nicely scented though.  The Green Apple was subtle and not overwhelming. The shampoo is very thick and it was soothing on my winter-dry scalp.  (I think you know you are getting old when your scalp gets dry during the winter.)  I am just going to pass this on to my husband since he loved the way it left his hair squeaky clean and got rid of the little bit of dandruff he has.",AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,4.0,3.0,4.0

"Greenair Spa Vapor Advanced Wellness Instant Healthful Mist Therapy, (Colors may vary)",4.0,"This is a decent diffuser. It holds about 2/3 cup of water. It runs  about 3hrs straight maybe, can't be set for intervals of cutting on/off. It cuts off when the water/oil runs out. It blows forcefully so the mist doesn't just fall on the table/counter surface, but it gets into the air to circulate. One thing, not sure if it will cause any problems later on, but if I plug in the outlet to the wall and THEN plug the end into the diffuser it has sparked at the point of the plug-to-diffuser. The size is a little awkward for me, maybe my hands are too small, with its smooth surface it can be slippery to hold one-handed.

Super Orgasm by NARS is a glowing, dispersed mash of papaya and raspberry shade with a metallic cloud of shimmer with tiny bits of chunky glitter. That might sound scary but its so wonderfully fine that it looks radiant and as if it was coming from within. For everyday makeup I reach for this no matter what Im wearing or what makeup goes on, it just looks alive even before I have my coffee without looking over done.

 This shade is sultry and sun kissed with this Hollywood Photoshop filler thing going on, it simply looks delicious. I love the whole range and Im also a fan of the NARS Sin  and Orgasm blushes, but this is the best.

"NARS Blush, Gaiety",5.0,"The color Orgasm, is a peachy pink with gold flecks.  On, it looks just like a natural flush.  I use it when I wear brown, peach or khaki clothing.  The gold flecks are not glittery at all and they add just a touch of sheen.  I also have the Nars Multiple in Orgasm, which I use first, then I go over it with the Orgasm powder formula, which together, provide all day wear.  The Super Orgasm is a coral flecked with gold, more gold than the Orgasm but still subtle.  Coral is a universally flattering shade and is especially pretty with summer colors.  Even in the winter, it keeps me from looking sallow.  Although I'm light, but not fair, with hazel eyes and dark blond hair, Super Orgasm would be equally pretty on medium or olive skin or African American coloring.  The formula lasts all day without changing color or fading, so you won't need to touch it up.  I love Nars makeup, except the foundation, and I use the creme blush in Cactus Flower under the Super Orgasm powder blush to give it extra staying power.  My skin is oily but if you chose to use just the powder blush, it would be fine for normal or dry skin types.  I've had these Nars blushes for several years and have yet to put a dent in them. It takes only a swipe or two with a brush to get the proper amount of product.  Granted, I don't use either one every day but there's a considerable amount of product in each so they're very economical.  They are unique and totally worth the extra cash.

It was the smallest little compact of blush I'd ever seen and I'd never spent that much on blush before. The next morning when I was applying my makeup I tried it, heeding the warnings that a little goes a long way. I was blown away!!

It brightens every feature; I have ivory skin with freckles and blue green eyes. My eyes were so blue green! And as for the reviews that say there is too much glitter, I would disagree. I notice a bit of shimmer, but no actual chunks of glitter. It has the right amount of glow for me, and I'm 37.

4. Desire
A scary bright bright bright pink in the pan but also very good quality giving cheeks the natural flush you crave for everyday. I've also seen this one on deeper skin tones and it still looks natural and flattering
5. Love joy
I was wondering if this would show up or just look like shimmer on my skin. After application it was a brownish berry color with slight shimmer and the blush I choose when I'm doing a strong smoky or colorful eye look. Looks very natural on my skin tone. Can't really be used to contour because it has the berry tone. The nars site describes this of a bronzed rose but on skin tones similar to mine would be berry toned.
6. Exhibit A
I've seen this on light medium and deep skin tones and it is widely flattering! Turns more red than orange on my skin but can look more orange on you depending on your undertones. Every woman should have this one in their arsenal. Some people believe this gives the most natural looking flush of all. It also photographs really well and looks good on video! Lol :)

Start your collection with any one of these if you're skin tone is similar to mine. NARS blush is one of the best blush brands out there I encourage you to try at least one even thought they have a higher price point. They are very pigmented and last a long time too!

I have grown my collection!
Torrid : a peachy shimmer....you would not believe how beautiful this is on my cheek...that lit from within look!

Sin: glowy mauvy cheeks very beautiful. Also gorgeous on lighter skin tones to my own

But this one, not good for me. Not in any way.
If you already have some kind of 'orange' vibe going on, you probably want to steer away from this one. I am pasty pale with auburn/copper red hair, this just made me look like the Wendy's sign. It was not good with my base coloring.

I gave it 3 because no matter that the color looks bad on me, the product quality is still there. This would look incredible on someone with pigment in their skin, I'm almost envious of anyone who could wear this, just because it's so pretty in the pan. If you are darker than 'fresh death', this color will probably work on you. Just like any other NARS blush, a light hand will go a lot farther than digging in.

"NARS Blush, Gaiety",2.0,"Why do they call this 'orgasm'? Because all you see are sparkles??? ugh.

I am very pale, and have auburn/reddish hair. This color SHOULD in theory look pretty spiffy on me, but I can't get past the fact that it looks like a GLITTERBOMB exploded on my face. What the ..>?!?!?!?!? And easy to overdo? Yes indeed! This blush is very very silky and soft; use a light hand. You can always add more but woe be to anyone who overapplies it. You'll look like a feverish clown!

For us (ahem) older ladies, try the Deep Throat. Pretty much the same color, without the glitty garbage all over every pore on your face!

UPDATE: I have the Orgasm/Laguna duo (reviews and photos and comparisons to other products coming soon) and it has been sitting ever since my horrifying discovery out in daylight, that there were glitter bits on my face from using the Orgasm blush. I have since discovered---your brush makes a LOT of difference. I switched to a very fluffy Real Techniques brush instead of my usual blush brush; it deposited gentle color and the glitter was very iffy. (As in, you couldn't really see obvious glitter but if you were verycloselikethis you could see tiny bits) I have revised my review a little bit. Still giving the advice that it's easy to overapply and, this color is sure not for everyone, but I don't want to shoot it with a silver bullet any more. If your skin has any tendency towards redness at all, I implore you to do a test run with this before you count on it looking good for any important (or public) event! I practically have to get microscopic amounts of this on the brush or it's too much for me, and does nothing positive to enhance my complexion.

"NARS Blush, Gaiety",5.0,"I really love NARS blushes and I always am searching for the perfect color. I currently own: Luster, Albatross, Torrid, Orgasm and Taj Mahal blushes. I gave torrid a try because I am an light olive skin complexion (NC20-NC30) and I thought it would look great on me. With the Orgasm blush I have to layer it on with a pretty heavy hand and I wanted something I could use less of, but same color wise.
 I will def say I was a bit disappointed with the color, but maybe that was just my expectations. I was hoping that it would be a lot more pigmented that the NARS Orgasm, but in the identical color range. Sadly, It isn't.
The orgasm blush is a peachy pink with golden sheen. Almost like a blush and highlight in one. The Torrid blush is burnt reddened pink with golden micro glitter. Not overly glitter, but very different that the golden sheen that Orgasm gives you. These differences might be good for you if you were looking for blushes that were in a league of there own, but I am not. I find that this blush typically lasts about 6 good hours on me. Just for reference I have combo skin, meaning I have a oily T-zone and regular skin type on my cheeks. Not dry and not oily.

If you are looking for a blush that would compliment both lighter skintones and darker skintones, get Torrid. Don't be afraid of the color or how pigmented it is. Get a stippling brush or a synthetic brush and grab a bit of color and blend. You can always go back and get more color, but if you add too much at one time, you will get the clown cheek effect. I have to add that this blushes lasts a very long time. I have had it for about 2 years now and still have yet to hit pan.

Update:I would like to also add that since buying this, it has gone up by a dollar.

UPDATE #2: I still own this product and I have to say I love it because its different than my other blushes. I originally was hoping it was similar to another blush I own, but I'm now glad it's not.",A121Z2MIFURY0O,4.5675675675675675,5.0,4.0
"NARS Blush, Gaiety",5.0,"Some of the colors look scary in the compact because they are so highly pigmented. Exhibit A, for example, is a bright clownish looking orange-red that surely has scared off many a gal. But for those who know how to use a blush brush properly (ie, high quality bristles, good construction, a judicious amount of pressure, good blending), these babies pay off. And I mean pay off not just in beautiful color, but in how long they last, because this quality and pigmentation means you don't need to use a lot. One of these can last you a long, long time, even with daily use.

I have Exhibit A, Torrid, Taos, Crazed, Luster, and Mata Hari, which covers a range of warm and cool tones. Exhibit A is my fave go to red blush. Using just a touch of my duo-fibre MAC brush on it (ie MAC 187 brush), this deposits a beautiful, face-brightening blush to the cheeks. Too much and you look like Bozo, so this does require restraint.

Mata Hari is a lovely, feminine, cool pink-rose tone that I, who have olive skin, can wear and look like I was out walking briskly. Those two are my fave ones from NARS as they are matte. The others have some shimmer and require even more care in application and go well with a shiny gloss on the lips.

Luster is more like a highlighting color for me (it's a goldeny-lustrous color on me). It's pretty much the color of my skin with shimmer, so I can put it on without a color payoff, but it gives a nice glow that I like for days when I look ""tired"". A perking up thing. Also nice for adding glow when going out at night/to a party. On a lighter person, it's probably a nice warmth on the cheeks, sort of like a subtle bronzer. Could probably highlight eyes, all over, too. It's versatile.

Crazed is a deep raspberry pink with shimmer (ie, a cooler color that has glowiness). Taos is like a somewhat warm deep rosed-up red. It's a color that will definitely suit darker tones, but can be used by fairer women with much restraint. Torrid is a gorgeous deep peachy sort of tone with shimmer. I'm wearing it today with Manhunt by NARS (lipstick) overlaid with Red Devil coral-red gloss by MAC. Torrid is not as deeply-intense as Crazed or Taos, but it's not a shy color either. Will give a nice payoff.

I'm med-dark olive toned (NC44 in MAC) and all those look fine on me. I'm ordering Gilda to add to the peachy colors in my blush collection (which right now includes two MAC peachy tones and one by Physician's Formula). With summer coming in, I'm looking for peachier/warmer tones.

These are expensive-ish, but these are top-notch, and it's no wonder makeup artists and celebrities love NARS blushes. (Note: I don't own the much-touted, much-beloved, nearly legendary Orgasm, though, which is more suited to ligther-than-me gals, but it really is pretty in the pan. I have heard good things about Super Orgasm colorwise, if you don't mind having chunks of glitter fall off your brush.)

UPDATE: I got my Gilda blush and it's lovely. A soft-textured, nicely-pigmented matte peach that will look fabulous with peachy-coral and more orangey glosses for Spring and summer, or even with nude glosses.",A1WX42M589VAMQ,4.5675675675675675,5.0,4.0

Nature's Alchemy Humming Bird Delight,5.0,"I had this necklace on my wishlist for ages. It was pricey but I loved it and was hoping the price would drop a bit. It finally did and I snagged it. I am a big believer in essential oils for mood and health and have a number of essential oil necklaces and bracelets but I liked this one so much because it has a hummingbird on it. I absolutely adore hummingbirds. I also liked that it was chunky and looked well made.

It definitely IS well made. The chain is sturdy and the one inch circular pendant is very detailed. You can see every detail of the hummingbird and flowers. It opens so you can out a can put a cotton ball or cotton round inside with essential oils on it. The openwork of the pendant allows the aroma to waft out but I doubt anyone would know it is an essential oil necklace because it is so pretty on its own. It's a bit of a Southwestern piece with a dangling drop at the end. I love it. It gets a lot of compliments and even more when I show people that the pendant opens to use an an essential oil holder. I suppose you could also put a photo or something similar inside as well.

In all, a very well made necklace/pendant by Nature's Alchemy. I attached some photos but these days they often don't show up so I can only hope.

It has a slight petal peach color and highlights the cheekbone and apples of the cheek. I use my primer, then brush on foundation, I then use the mineral blush on the apples of my cheeks.

The one detraction I have for this product and hence the 4-star rating is the price. At about $.25/ounce this is not cheap stuff. The last time I purchased a bottle of Scope I paid right around $.09/ounce. So take that for what it's worth. I do believe the Crest product is better. But for a price conscious consumer it's an important delineation.",A2Q2A6JKY95RTP,3.6,4.0,4.0
Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Mouthwash 473 Ml,3.0,"I am a big fan of oral care and have tried many different mouthwashes looking for the best brand and none have really stuck out as ""the best"".  After trying Crest Pro-Health that notion has not changed.  The label says it is ""Our most advanced rinse ever"" but I did not notice much difference from the old version.  It does claim to not only reduce plaque and prevent gingivitis, but prevent plaque regrowth and reverse gingivitis in two weeks.  But that is really a claim you should ask your dentist about.  This is a mint flavor (officially the flavor is ""Deep Clean Mint"") but is not overtly strong like some mouthwashes.  This mouthwash does foam up very quickly which is very annoying.  Also I am disappointed there are still mouthwash out there that does not come with a self measuring cap because does anyone really knows how much is 20mL.  But overall this is an average mouthwash that is worth a try if you are looking to try a new mouthwash.",A1LHAXBM5GBJS2,3.6,3.0,4.0
Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Mouthwash 473 Ml,5.0,"I have used a variety of ""mouthwashes"", starting with my mother's Listerine, the odor of which I do not like. At a certain point I eliminated alcohol from my life and since that substance is absorbed on the tongue, I went in search of mouthwashes that did not contain it. This rinse is not emblazoned with the ""Alcohol Free"" claim (it is there in fine print); the ingredients do not list alcohol. My bottle gives the ingredients as: Active ingredient - Cetylpyridinium chloride 0.1%; Inactive ingredients - water, glycerin, hydrogen peroxide, flavor, sucralose, poloxamer 407.

Since I like the idea of a whitening mouthwash that can help me combat the inevitable coffee staining, I had been using Crest 3D White, which is alcohol free but which a lot of reviewers don't like because of its hydrogen peroxide. Some of those people have complained that it made their teeth - or maybe gums - sensitive.  So I have compared the two.

I like this Crest Pro-Health Clinical Oral Rinse better. My mouth feels cleaner. And I do have a couple of tooth/gum problems that it seems to help with. I have used the two interchangeably for comparison purposes. I use this daily, or I should say nightly before bed, following thorough brushing and flossing. Just think of the millions of bacteria it kills, that can't etch your teeth with their acid.

With this rinse, I do notice sensitivity of gums and/or teeth when rinsing with clear water after use. I do that because there is some theory that hydrogen peroxide should not remain in the mouth. The sensitivity, which is certainly akin to pain, is not sufficiently severe to make me stop using the rinse.

UPDATE: After I got through the sample I was sent, I went looking for more but could not find any in our local stores. So I sent for some from Amazon; I like it that much. (That's one way to use the Vine program: make consumers out of us.)",A2OL5WLCNZVD9K,3.6,5.0,4.0
Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Mouthwash 473 Ml,3.0,"I am an ounce-of-prevention is worth a pound-of-cure guy.  My current favorite is Crest 3D White mouthwash, so I was excited to try this new Crest Pro-Health Clinical mouthwash.

I did not have any of the burning experienced by others, but this stuff is just weird.  After about 20-30 seconds, you feel blobs of gunk floating around in your mouth.  I don't know if it's itself coagulating or dissolved parts of my mouth or both, but a mouthful of white, stringy blobs is gross.  It takes quite a bit of rinsing to get all of the yuck out of my mouth.  Performance-wise, it does seem to be effective, and hence the 3 stars.

I have tried other mouthwashes in the past that also dissolved my mouth, but with those, there was a slough-off later after using it -- not while using it.  The Crest Clinical is somewhat of a turn-off in a nauseating sort of way because of this.  Definitely try a very small bottle first as I was tempted to throw it out many times.  I will stay with the Crest 3D White for now.

I have also recently tried the Colgate Optic White mouthwash, and while I love the Optic White toothpaste, the mouthwash (which performs well) borderlines on burning and tastes like bleach.",A2EHYCA29NSQLU,3.6,3.0,4.0
Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Mouthwash 473 Ml,3.0,"Another reviewer pointed out that because of the compounds this mouthwash contains, you should always rinse after using it. This mouthwash seems to be something between a standard Listerine style mouthwash and the very serious prescription mouthwashes one can get.

On the plus side, it feels like it is a serious mouthwash that is cleaning away bacteria.

On the negative side, the aftertaste is potent.

I doubt I would get this mouthwash again due to the aftertaste and concern over the rinsing issue.",A36JO8IHKYBMMJ,3.6,3.0,4.0
Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Flavor Mouthwash 237 mL,2.0,"In my case the foaming did not bother me. That is probably because, knowing there was hydrogen peroxide in it, I rinsed my mouth twice after using it.

However, I noticed that if I failed to rinse my white sink thoroughly after spitting it out, in the morning there were brown stains. I could get them off the porcelain fairly easily but that combined with the staining reports of other reviewers is enough evidence to look elsewhere for an alcohol-free mouthwash. In my opinion, it is downright stupid of a manufacturer to market a product that they know stains teeth, saying as they do here, ""In some cases, antimicrobial rinses may cause surface staining to teeth. This is not permanent or harmful, and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit.""

People who care about their appearance do not want filthy-looking teeth, even temporarily. Some may attempt to scrape off the offending film (which is probably oxidized plaque that inevitably forms on some surfaces even with good brushing) and in so doing, damage the enamel of their teeth.

Proctor & Gamble gives you 60 days in which you can get a refund if not satisfied. In this case I bought ahead so as to not run out (don't most people?), so I'm out of luck there.",A2OL5WLCNZVD9K,3.5,2.0,4.0

Revitalash By Revitalash Revitalash Advanced Eyelash Conditioner-- 3.5 Ml / .118 Oz,1.0,"I used the first generation Revitalash with the Bimatoprost prostaglandan analogue in it, and my lashes became long and lush. I gave it a good review here on Amazon.

Unfortunately, due to a patent infringement with Allergen, they had to take the bimatoprost out of it and as a result, the product no longer works for me.  I believe it may still contains some sort of prostaglandin but if so,  one that is less effective for me. I miss my long eyelashes.

I just ordered the Phillip Thomas Roth ""Lashes to Die For"", and we'll see if that works any better.  If not, I guess I'll bite the bullet and get Latisse, which is bimatoprost but which requires a prescription.  (And, which is way more expensive than the original Revitalash ever was.)

If you do choose to use an eyelash enhancer with prostoglandin, you need to be diligent - you have to use it nightly and it can take 8 weeks to see results.  People who use it sporadically for a few weeks and give it negative reviews aren't using it right.

Bee Yummy Skin Food (2oz.),4.0,"Oh, wow. I thought I was the only one who had discovered this conceptually great skin food in my East Village neighborhood, at the Live Live boutique. I wandered in, captivated by Bee Yummy's minimalistic ingredient listing: honey, honey cappings, bee pollen, st. johns wort oil, royal jelly, water, and balsam needles.

After trying a sample---- amazed by the non-sticky residual, super quick absorption, and raw, organic goodness--- i snapped up a whole selection of Live Live products: Bee Yummy, the Honey Face Mask (very pricey), and the Love Butter (100% pure coconut oil). Out of all 3 products, the Bee Yummy and Love Butter are the best.

Bee Yummy quickly sinks into skin like a serum. It is best for oily skins or young skins who don't need extra hydration. Unfortunately, it doesn't do much to truly hydrate as it has the texture of a very light water-based, ""teen-ish"" moisturizer. It will NOT keep you moisturized in the dead of winter--you'll still need something more occlusive. But no doubt it's good for your skin --so, i use it as a underserum before applying my heavy duty moisturizer and after my vitamin C potions as a ""middle layer"".

If you are looking for a basic, oil-free type of hydrator, why use one laden with chemicals when you can use this? If you are looking for anti-aging superpowers, forget it. This won't help, but it won't hurt. I have not had any miraculous ""magic"" healing with this product and don't expect it to. It is not a magic potion.  Take Bee Yummy for what it is: a organic, natural alternative to a basic light moisturizer.",AZ26CDSJ363AH,4.0,4.0,4.0

I apply the shower gel to wet body or scalp. Lather, rinse, and repeat. If using as a bubble bath, drizzle a generous amount under running water and enjoy.

This has a sweet, soft egg nog scent. I now am going to order for my daughter. Philosophy has a name that is well known and well regarded. You can count on this product to be well received.

Colgate Enamel Health Mouthwash,5.0,"A really nice, pleasant taste that makes your breath sparkling. It's hard to say what kind of impact this has on your enamel in such a short review time. This is one of those things where you have to keep using it and rely on the company that it's being accurate.

Meanwhile, it's got a good taste, works well on bad breath, and the price is right. What's not to like?",A2JCJJNY43QQIV,3.727272727272727,5.0,4.0
Colgate Enamel Health Mouthwash,4.0,"I think I may be in the minority here. I really love the ""clean"" feel of Listerine (a product that is heavily endorsed by my dentist and hygienist), and genuinely missed it here. But I also use ACT ... so, I am used to products that don't necessarily provide that exciting tingle (my dentist has me use Listerine in the morning and ACT before bed). So, I replaced my Listerine with this and while my mouth didn't feel as excitingly clean, it claims to protect enamel, so that might be a nice bonus.

After this bottle is gone, I plan on returning to Listerine (I supposed it is a part of my routine now ... and I am always loathe to deviate from the course of action my dentist plans for me). However, this seems to do no harm and could be great for those with a low-threshold for strong products like Listerine (there is a person in my family who does not use Listerine because they find it painful ... this would be ideal for her). So, if this is you, give it a try. (If you like it, then consult your dentist).",A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,3.727272727272727,4.0,4.0
Colgate Enamel Health Mouthwash,4.0,"Colgate Enamel Health Anticavity Fluoride Sparkling Fresh Mint Mouthwash is a mild mouthwash that is alcohol free, and doesn't have the ""alcohol burn"" of other mouthwashes. Colgate claims that the mouthwash helps replenish natural calcium back into enamel and reverses enamel softening to help prevent cavities. These are bold claims, and I'd take them with a grain of salt. I'm sure there is some benefit compared to brushing alone though. The fresh mint flavor isn't overpowering and pleasant. Colgate Enamel Health Anticavity Fluoride Sparkling Fresh Mint Mouthwash is a good mouthwash for anyone that doesn't want the alcohol burn of other mouthwashes.",A2UOHALGF2X77Q,3.727272727272727,4.0,4.0
Colgate Enamel Health Mouthwash,4.0,"My teen has been using this mouthwash for about two years.  I'm not sure why but both of my children have had a problem with cavities.  I believe it's because we have well water which isn't fluoridated.  We have always been brushers.

My son I can't quite get used to using the mouthwash, but my daughter does and I'm sure it's the non-alcoholic nature of the wash that makes it acceptable as it's not that sting-y.

SUMMARY
Since my young teenagers are using this mouthwash I wanted one without alcohol.  My daughter uses it on a regular basis and for about two years.  It's impossible to say whether the mouthwash has worked or if the kids are just flossing and brushing more effectively, but they have had fewer cavities and improved dental reports.",AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,3.727272727272727,4.0,4.0
Colgate Enamel Health Mouthwash,5.0,"This has a mild mint flavor which is important to me since the instructions say not to eat or drink anything for 30 minutes after using this.  After using some mouth rises I often need to rinse out my mouth with water because the taste is so strong  but not this one. After using this my mouth tastes fine.

I like the fact that this is supposed to replenish natural calcium back into enamel and reverse enamel softening as well.  I also like the fact that this is alcohol free.

My dentist has me using a fluoride toothpaste at night. I use this after meals in the morning and evening.  This seems like a good compliment to the toothpaste since a liquid will get to hard to reach places a toothpaste will not.

It has a pleasant flavor that lasts in my mouth for quite a while after using it, leaving my breath minty fresh.  It's also alcohol free, which I like.  If you're someone who consistently uses ""natural"" products, you should skip this mouthwash as it contains two kinds of artificial sweeteners along with quite a few different chemicals that make some people uneasy.

Colgate Enamel Health Mouthwash,2.0,"OK, I've never actually tasted bleach, but the aftertaste is horrible and smells like bleach.

While I am a HUGE fan of Colgate Optic White toothpaste (by far my favorite), I was sorely disappointed when Colgate came out with this.  I have been using Crest 3D White rinse as part of my regimen, and I had high hopes for this based on the toothpaste.

I can say that it is effective, possibly on the order of or even a hair better than the Crest 3D White in terms of cleaning/whitening, but the offensive taste is just not worth it.  Also, I feel it is stronger and can lead to a burning sensation if I rinse too long.

In all, I will stick to Crest 3D White Glamorous White.

Note that I do NOT like Crest Pro-Health (clear blue bottle) or their Pro-Health Clinical.

Glide Pro-Health For Life Smooth Mint Floss 35 Meters,2.0,"For the past few years, I've been using&nbsp;Glide Comfort Plus Dental Floss.  It was the floss that got rid of the gunk between my teeth, without hurting my gums.  At least most of the time.  There are a few times per month, when my gums are extra sensitive, that flossing irritates my gums, even with the Comfort Plus floss.

When given the opportunity to try Glide Pro-Health for Life, I was excited.  Since I'm over 50, and it's made by the same company that makes my normal floss, I figured it had to be even better.  I was disappointed.  This floss looks even thinner than the Comfort Plus that I normally use, so I assumed that it would be even less irritating to my gums than the Comfort Plus floss usually is.  Boy was I wrong!!!  Every time I floss with the Pro-Health for Life floss, my gums swell and hurt for at least a day.  This hurts worse than my normal (Comfort Plus) ever did -- and it hurts every time.

I've gone back to using&nbsp;Glide Comfort Plus Dental Floss, full time.  Your mileage may vary, but for my oral health, this Oral-B Glide Pro-Health for Life floss is not for me.",A16AXQ11SZA8SQ,3.6666666666666665,2.0,4.0
Glide Pro-Health For Life Smooth Mint Floss 35 Meters,4.0,"I like Glide floss and have been using it for years in it's various iterations.  The one I am currently comparing this Pro-Health For Life version to is the&nbsp;Glide-Crest Dental Floss - 43.7 yd, 6 pack.  The packaging is different, and the taste is different ... but those are all of the differences that I could discover between the two Glide products.  Sometimes a product ventures into a different market - in this case, the 50+ (I'm 47 and I thought I qualified for this sub-group).

I wanted to qualify a few things and speak to two different audiences here:

1) To the Glide Floss Newbie - Glide offers a wonderful, easy flossing experience especially for those of us who have teeth with very small space between them.  The Glide products will put your regular floss to shame ... I used the standard&nbsp;Johnson & Johnson Reach Mint Waxed Dental Floss 55 yards (Pack of 6)&nbsp;in some form or another for most of my life ... until I discovered Glide.  Glide is like a ribbon, not s string, and does a nice job.  In the past, it used to tout ""Teflon"" for creating a smooth experience between tight teeth.  I am unsure of this anymore as it isn't labeled as such as it was in the past.

2) To those who use Glide Already - there is no big difference besides a longer, stronger mint taste and a shorter amount of floss in the packaging.  (40 m vs 35 m in the new one).  Both products acted the same for me.  Same size, feel ... just a stronger, aftertaste with Pro-Health for Life version.

I don't see any comparative pricing listed ... but if I saw that the new stuff was priced significantly more expensive, I would knock my review down a star.  It really seems like the same stuff with a minor taste tweak and an entirely new target market.",A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8,3.6666666666666665,4.0,4.0

Im one bottle in and things are going ok. I take 4 daily with no stomach irritation or other problems. The pills don't taste that good and start dissolving upon contact with water. I take them with lots of water. So far my shedding as increased and is causing me concern. I haven't seen a change in the condition of my hair or balding areas yet and no uptake in growth rate either.

Of note, I was already taking most of the ingredients listed as contained in Toji in other supplements. So I expected this to kick in quicker since I have the vitamins, herbs and minerals already in my system for the last several (6-8) months. That hasn't happened but I'm  Still hopeful , I will update in another 30 days.

Updated_ July 27

Two days away from concluding my second bottle and so far....I have no increase in my hair growth ( i only get 1/8"" a month) , no increase in shine ( my hair's still frizzy and unruly) or thickness either( still thinning with bald spots).  I have increased shedding and breakage since I started to take these, which is upsetting to me.  My fingernails do seems to grow fast but that is all that I have noticed.  I am not happy with my experience  taking these so far.

Update August 28- added stars to my rating.

Beginning my fourth bottle and I'm finally noticing a betterment in my hair. It still grows slowly but I have noticeably growing hair at my edges. Shedding and breakage has decreased and my hair seems a  little thicker. . It looks much better than it did three months
ago or even one month ago.

Update at 4 months: September 25

Still no faster growth and only minor thickening. I've reduced my dosage to half... One in the morning and one in evening and so far no change in the condition of my hair. From my last update. i think ive gotten all I'll  get from these. I plan to continue two a day for the time  being until I can find something else.

Final review october 2013

I no longer take these. I saw only minor improvement in the condition of my hair after almost 5 months at high dosage, which was four a day. My fingernails grew pretty fast but that's it.  I saw no regrowth in bald/thinning areas and no change in growth rate either.  I've stopped taking them and so far, nothing happened. No shedding or breaking etc. Seemed they weren't that effective for me. Very pricey fail.

February 2014 second try

I'm desperate to stop my hair loss so I'm giving these another try. It seems they were effective in slowing my loss and some increase in thickness. Since I stopped taking them it seems my hair went back to very thin.  It took about three months to show. So if this worked and I didn't notice it's worth a second try.

"Age Defying Caffeine Eye Cream | 1 OZ | Puffy Eyes, Dark Circles, Fine Lines, Wrinkles | All Natural and Organic Ingredients: Contains Hyaluronic Acid | Cruelty Free | Made in USA!",2.0,"UPDATE:
I gave this product one extra star because it has lasted me for 6 months, and I think I still have a month left in the bottle. I won't be buying it again, but feel like I should hand out another star simply because this product lasts such A LONG TIME. My usage averages twice a day, using a partial (mini) pump.

One other thing: I believe my bottle wasn't properly mixed or stirred or something. The first months of usage were terribly stinky, and left my skin so shiny with oil. Later in the bottle, the smell has eased up and I'm getting more of a matte look. Goodness knows what's going on.

For the record, my lines haven't improved and the darkness around my eyes is the same.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I've been using Skin2Spirit eye whip for a while now, as per the directions, waiting and waiting for improvement. Every time I apply it, I increasingly dislike it. The smell is strong and unpleasant, cloyingly sweet like coffee syrup.

Skin2Spirit Eye Whip comes in a pump that pumps out too much; I try to do a half pump and am occasionally successful in getting out the right amount. It has the consistency of a thick cream. It feels like it absorbs, however, it leaves an oily sheen wherever you've applied it. I can see the line of where my eye whip ends and my facial lotion begins, as my facial lotion is oil-free.

This eye whip reeks so much my family has commented to me at different times why I 'stink' like ice cream, or coffee, or candy. Keep in mind, these comments come long after I've applied it, after it's dried. To me, it smells like coffee ice cream that's been baking in the sun all day: very sweet, cloying, pungent. Also, when I dry my hair with a hair dryer, the scent becomes strong again--heat activated--to my dismay.

My discoloration and fine lines have NOT improved with continuous use. I feel like my fine lines are actually worsening with use of this product, or else the oily sheen makes them look worse. My dark circles haven't lightened one iota.

Another thing I don't like about the product is that after I purchased it, I received an email from the owner, Kat, asking me (in other words) to give it 5 stars OR contact her to fix whatever problem I have with the eye whip. And what she really means is ""pay for more of my products"".

I've also read these long passages she's written, commenting on other people's reviews. I find her involvement in reviews unprofessional, as it comes across as her wanting to control reviews. Honest reviews can improve products because it gives companies feedback, without having to pay focus groups.

Kat also claims this eye whip works on ""99 out of 100"" people. Yeah, right. There is absolutely no science backing up this claim. I've worked in skin studies and NO company can honestly make this claim. I wish Kat would just tout the indisputable positives of the product: cruelty-free, vegan, entirely natural, paraben free, etc. instead of making more outlandish claims that aren't fact based.

I cannot recommend this product as it stands, and I wouldn't waste my money buying the unscented version either.",A1MAI0TUIM3R2X,4.25,2.0,4.0

The whip is thick and creamy. Pat it on and keep patting until it soaks in. Directions say to apply twice a day and give it a few weeks to work. Of course caffeine in cold green tea bags works wonders for your eye bags and dark circles, so I expect this to also do nice things for my eyes. The most important feature of this product is that the ingredients are organic and contain nothing ""chemical"".  The ingredients list is impressive! Some of the ingredients are: aloe, coconut oil, hyaluronic acid, green tea, cucumber, acai, blueberry, noni, goji, mangosteen, and many more good things.

Mad Hippie Face Cream with Anti Wrinkle Peptide Complex 1.0 ounces,2.0,"UPDATE ON 8-28-17:  Since I first purchased this, I've been getting really bad skin rashes and welts on my face after using this.  I have sensitive skin, and know that this product is causing the reaction since it only happens when I use this.  While I like the other Mad Hippie products I've tried, I'd stay away from this one if you have skin that is easily irritated.  One or more of the ingredients is definitely too strong if you have bad reactions!
-------

I recently ordered the Mad Hippie Face Cream, Exfoliating Serum, and Antioxidant Facial Oil, and really like them a lot.  I've only been using them a few days, so I'll be sure to update my review as I use these more, but so far I like the fact that this is a healthier brand, with not many chemicals added to their products.

This Face Cream is not quite hydrating enough for me, but I've found that using the Antioxidant Facial Oil on top helps seal in moisture.

The Mad Hippie website also gives instructions for how to layer their products:

""We recommend gently massaging the vitamin C serum into your skin in the morning after washing and drying thoroughly.  Wait 5 minutes after applying the serum & apply the creams.  Apply the face cream to the entire face, including eye area, then apply the eye cream beside and below the eyesmaking sure to rub both creams in well, particularly around wrinkle prone areas.  Follow this with our extra hydrating antioxidant facial oil.

At night, follow the same steps but replace the vitamin C serum with an exfoliant:  either the exfoliating serum or vitamin A serum.  If just using the creams, wait a couple minutes after washing your face when skin is fully dry to apply. The facial SPF should be used as the final and last step of your morning routine.""",A2V5R832QCSOMX,2.5,2.0,4.0
Mad Hippie Face Cream with Anti Wrinkle Peptide Complex 1.0 ounces,3.0,"My friend suggested I give mad hippie products a try and I do like some but I'm still not sure about this one. I am currently using another brand that I love and the results are excellent  .However first off the bottle is so small I went through it fast. Second this was not hydrating enough for my skin and finally a wrinkle cream  ,I didn't notice any difference which so ever. The wrinkles I have are still noticeable not that I had expected them to magically disappear but I had a little hope that they may have been less noticeable. The reason for 3 stars is because it's natural ingredient list which is a plus and the excellent time frame as far as shipping and delivery. The packaging was good too. I am not gonna say I wouldnt give this another try at somepoint but for now I'm sticking to my other brand that I actually see results. This obviously works great for some as I have read in the reviews before placing my order but for the price and the fact I saw no results is enough for me to keep with my current brand. However I do use their vitamin c and really like that and also have the face wash which is nice because it doesn't strip my skin of the natural oils.",AENH50GW3OKDA,2.5,3.0,4.0

This razor speaks quality. I had the Norelco SpeedXL for over 10 years and it still working. I purchased its a newer technology and just because my older shaver is getting too old looking. If you have the budget to add the Jet Cleaning System I certainly recommend it. It works like a charm. After I shave, I open the heads, rinse with water, close, then insert in the Jet Cleaner this process helps keep the solution clean so I would last much longer than recommended. May be twice as much!

Philips Norelco 1250X SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor with Jet Clean System (Series 8000),5.0,"I'm 48 and I have been shaving with Norelco Electric Razors since I was about 16.  My first Norelco was a hand me down from my Grandfather, a two header.  My Great Grandfathers, Grandfather and Dad have all shaved with Norelcos. I collect them and have a vast number in my collection.  I have had them to go out before and Philips Norelco was always quick to replace the defective model.  My pride and joy of my Norelcos is my Spectra 8894xl James Bond Electric Razor. It give a very close shave and I still shave with it once and awhile. I recently replaced the blades in it and it still delivers a close comfortable shave. I am always looking for a way to get a close shave with an electric.  I have a refurbished Smart Touchxl and it to shaves really close. Now on to Senso Touch 1250cc.  I purachased a Senso Touch 1250x at Walmart for $217 including tax, then I saw the 1250cc on Amazon from Electronic Sonic for only $225 and with fast shipping, the total price was $235. I returned the 1250x back to Walmart and got the 1250cc on Amazon from Electronic Sonic.  I was able to get the razor with the jet clean system on Amazon for only $18 more, a deal! I checked around at Target and a few other stores and there were no stores in my state that carried the 1250cc only the 1250x. It took only 3 days to receive this razor.  It ships by UPS.  I have a heavy dark beard and usually have to shave twice a day.  I never did get a close shave with my Arcitec 1050cc. It took me about 7 min. to get anything that even resembled a descent shave.  I gave my Arcitec to my Dad 68 who has a light beard and he loves it. All I can say about the shave that I get from Senso Touch is WOW! It is close and leaves your face feeling really smooth! I shave with it both wet and dry, but the wet shave is very comfortable and resembles the shave that I use to get with my old Cool Skin which was only a wet shaver. The razor comes in a big box and resembles a present. It is very expensive, but let me tell you, this razor is worth the extra money! It  takes a while to open it which in it are several smaller boxes which contain various parts of the shaving system. It really is a shaving system and it is was well worth the extra money. In the box, you will find the razor, the jet clean system, a bottle of jet clean solution, a charging stand ( charging stand does not come with the Arcitec 1050cc ), a soft pouch ( which is much better than the storage and charging pod of the Arcitec 1050cc ), a cleaning  brush, a protective cap, a power cord, and a quick start guide, and a useage booklet. On the razor itsself is a 3 level battery display which shows: cleaning indicator, battery high and low indicators which are shown in blocks, replacement head indicator, and travel lock indicator. This is a ruby black frame with a hidden display.  The razor has the GyroFlex 3D System, UltraTrack Heads, and SkinGlide System. This razor is Aquatec which means you can shave with it both wet and dry. This razor has a EasyGrip which ensures complete control and extra precision. The razor heads unlike the Arcitec can be taken apart and each one cleaned individually and you can wash out the razor and just let it dry. The jet clean system, which is very cool to watch in action, cleans and lubracates the razor heads.  I plan to use it about once a week to save on the cleaning solution.  Now when I shave, I use Afta Pre Electric and a little talc which helps to deliver a smooth shave. I do not use Williams Lectric Shave anymore as it cloggs the razor and it is very greasey.  Afterwards, I put on a little Nivea Post Shaving Balm.  When I shave wet, I use Nivea Shaving Gel. Philips tells you to wait about 3 weeks for your face to get ajusted to this shaving system.  I did experience a little irritation, red burn, on the lower part of my nck, but it could be due to fact I pressed too hard with the razor, but it is getting better evertime I shave. I love this razor and I am very happy with my purchase on Amazon. Like I said this razor is expensive, but I am a Pastor and I want to look good in the pulpit and this razor, so far is getting the job done! You can get the razor with a numeric display, but this model is sufficient for me.  If you have any questions concerning this razor please email me at: [...] Happy Shaving, Michael, Baton Rouge, LA",A2BVRKJ12P1HDY,4.666666666666667,5.0,4.0
Philips Norelco 1250X SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor with Jet Clean System (Series 8000),4.0,"This is a very stylish design for a shaver. It's lightweight and has an ergonomic feel in the hand and against the face according to my husband. When it arrived I realized we were dealing with a ""system"" as it came in a HUGE box full of multiple smaller boxes of components and accessories. The SensoTouch Shaver sort of has it's own little universe on my husband's bathroom counter right now and I wasn't expecting THAT. There's the razor itself, it's charging stand, it's cleaning box, the bottle of cleaning solution, the blade cover, the brush that cleans the moustache trimmer, and the travel case. All those gizmos serve good purposes and are nice to have in and of themselves, but my goodness... we've sort of gone beyond a quick morning shave and into the domain of manscaping at this point!

When it arrived, the battery was totally dead, so into the charger it went. Within about 90 minutes the battery was completely charged and ready to go. No fuss, no muss and no waiting overnight. That is a very nice feature - super fast charging. The power button is a flush push button on the front of the razor, easy to find and the power indicator is a row of L.E.D. lights going up the front of the unit with a futuristic look that just adds another touch of style to the whole look. Overall a really nice design.

The mustache trimmer pops in & out of the top of the unit just behind the trimmer blades easily. It works smoothly and did a nice job evenening up my husband's mustache. Though using too much pressure will result in a cut to the upper lip very quickly. The razor itself for actual beard/face shaving was close and did a fine job with only one real complaint from the man of the house. He groused about the fact that the blades missed some of the hair along his neck line requiring multiple passes over the same area. We're not sure why this happened - it may be the location of the area, it may be that the hair on the neck line is finer than the hair on the rest of his face or it may be something about the razor. What he did say was that shaving with a regular hand razor or his ancient Norelco electric razor he did not need to make multiple passes in the same way as with this new SensoTouch 3d Razor. So overall... he does like this razor and will continue to use it, but wishes it took up less real estate on his counter top.

Vktech Hair Braider Twist Styling Braid Tool Magic Wonder Holder Clip DIY French,3.0,"The concept behind the Magic Wonder Holder Clip is very simple.  Basically, take a strand from one side of the head, cross it over the braider and place it in the groove on the other side.  Start from the top and keep alternating sides.

At the beginning of the braid, we have to hold onto the hair and the braider.  After a few strands have been gathered, we can let go and use both hands to just gather hair.  It's easier to use this on someone else than on oneself.  If you're like me and are not coordinated enough to French braid your daughter's hair, this might help.

The one thing I don't like is the length.  I often want to end but can't.  I ended up cutting off a bit of it and that worked.  Just use scissors.  Cutting off the end also helps the pointy end from pointing out of the hair.

Another problem is visibility: the gray color peeks through the hair.  If it were available in black, brown or blond, that would camouflage better.

It's not a bad braid, just not a great one.  Since all the hair ends up gathered under the braider, the ponytail at the end is not as nice as in a real French braid.  Instead of having three groups of strands to work with, we get a big, fat wad.  At least that's how it is with shoulder length hair.  Maybe it works out better with longer hair.  Maybe I need more practice.",A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,3.0,3.0,4.0

I've had reassuring success with Colgate Total, and since there are nights and days when I'm too tired or stressed to brush my teeth, this represents an almost-as-good substitute.

[Postscript: I hardly expected the above to be controversial.  (Hope it wasn't something I said.)  Practically everything in the review is reportage of ""personal experience,"" which no reader is qualified to ""refute.""  Since I gave the product 5 stars, I can only suspect that I offended a Crest fan (maybe the company's CEO or a Proctor and Gamble shareholder).  But I happen to like Colgate Total, and my last 3 check-ups have been complete successes--no extra dental work required.  The only ""claim"" that may be inviting some controversy is the very final clause.  Would it be acceptable if I changed it to: ""On those nights when I don't brush my teeth, rinsing with this product is ""better than nothing""?  (I'd be happy to change to that wording. But I could say the same thing about rinsing with plain water.  Moreover, a claim that weak certainly would not justify a 5-star rating.

Crest Pro-Health Collection Kit,3.0,"This is the first time I've received a bundled dental kit. It's like ""The Best of Crest Pro-Health"". I'm not sure who would buy such a kit (is it a birthday gift for someone who really loves their teeth? Or for a student going off to college? Or is it a CARE package for a loved one in the Armed Forces? Maybe). The only reason I see an ordinary consumer buying it is for purely economic reasons - if it's actually cheaper to buy this set rather than buying each individual item (which is what most people do). As of this date, Amazon has no price for the bundle, so I can't compare (I will update this review when the price appears once again).

The kit consists of the following:

Crest Pro-Health Healthy Fresh Toothpaste
Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Refreshing Clean Mint Mouthwash
Crest Pro-Health All-in-One Medium Toothbrush
Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss

First, the all-in-one medium toothbrush is decent but since I use Sonicare, it is of limited use to me. Since I have receding gums, I have given up using manual toothbrushes. However, for the everyday user (hubby) it works fine. Nothing special.

The second item that particularly interested me was the mouthwash. As some of you know, there has been controversy over Listerine because long-term use of any mouthwash containing alchohol is reputedly linked to oral cancer. Hence, I was interested to see if this Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free, Clean Mint mouthwash was a viable alterative.

It has a minty taste and leaves a mild, tingly feeling (definitely not as strong as Listerine). However, I understand from reading some reviews on this product that it contains a stain-causing chemical. Since I used it only few times, I can't judge whether this effect is true. So far my teeth look fine and I don't see any excessive brown stains. I can't speak for whether the mouthwash is any better than Listerine, though. Since alcohol does kill germs, I am suspicious that it may not be as effective for long term use as Listerine. As a compromise, I plan to alternate this mouthwash with Listerine.

Next. Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean Floss. I love Glide. No problems here, and I love the fact that it doesn't shred as easily as other brands do. The best part of this set for me.

Lastly, the toothpaste. According to the box, it has everything you'd want in a toothpaste: fights cavities, gingivitis, gum disease, brightens teeth and removes stains (ironic if the staining mouthwash rumors are true -you brush your teeth to get rid of stains only to get it back again!). However, it terms of taste, I didn't like it. While the color is a cool mint blue, it leaves your mouth with a strange burning sensation. I am a long time user of Colgate Total, and have never experienced this type of stinging. Strangely enough, it leaves your mouth with the effect that Listerine does! But I much prefer Colgate because I prefer my toothpaste to be bland - I'll leave the stinging feeling to the mouthwash.

There you have it. So I have mixed feelings about this kit because I couldn't verify where the mouthwash really leaves brown stains as other reviewers have pointed out. Time will tell, and I will update my review accordingly.",AMB2Z4FMDBWQY,3.0,3.0,4.0

"Crest + Oral-B Professional Gingivitis Kit, 1 Count",4.0,"The perfect, complete package for that person that needs an electric toothbrush.  Complete with toothpaste, floss and mouthwash, this would be a great gift.

The toothbrush has 5 settings, and it lists them in the description.  I prefer the sensitive setting, as I recently had gum surgery and am now very aware of how hard I am brushing, which leads me into that nice feature.  This toothbrush will slow and the red light will come on if you are brushing too hard.  I like that, because it reminds me to use lighter pressure.  It comes with a separate display that keeps track of how long you are brushing, and also has a clock.  The brush pauses when it is time to switch sides.  I like the carrying case, as you can place the unit and the separate brushes in it.

I think it is a bit much with the display, personally.  The separate display portion is kind of a hassle.  I also wish it had a setting memory.  Every time you restart the toothbrush, it starts over at the first setting, so I have to press the arrow down to get to the sensitive setting.  It takes about 7 seconds, so you have wasted that time with the brush out of your mouth, trying to find the correct setting you like.

I like it, it works well, there are just a few things I would prefer be different.  I prefer a little more of a simplistic toothbrush.",A3OC93X866Z8TB,4.714285714285714,4.0,4.0

I've had the other for about 10 years and it has done a great job for me and lasted.  The brush heads from that one fit this handle just fine.

The brush itself is quite a step up from the professional grade brush I bought from my dentist about 10 years ago.  There are extra modes and the smart guide timer (which works wirelessly) is a great feedback mechanism that times me at 30 seconds per side and also indicates if I am pressing too hard.  It's great feedback and the visual actually makes the time to brush go by quicker.

It's easy to think of it as a gimmick, but the smart guide is truly smart and a great way to get feedback and build better habits.

"Crest + Oral-B Professional Gingivitis Kit, 1 Count",5.0,"The Crest + Oral-Professional Gingivitis Kit has an electric toothbrush plus timer and case, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash in a disposable tote bag. There is a selection of four brush heads included, and I like the spinning head the best.  I have been using an Oral-B 1000 model for a few weeks so can compare it to this high-end 5000 model.

The charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts. At least when new, the battery will last for more than week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings. There are several brushing modes, including one for sensitive teeth and a mode with longer brushing times.  The sensitive mode is noticeably gentler.

This model will alert when a 30 or 45 second brushing time per quadrant has finished, by pulsing and with the little radio timer.  I don't really like the timer feature but it would be very helpful to teach a child how to brush; the visual reinforcement is effective.

The brush tips change easily but don't come off under use and they have colored rings to identify brush heads for multiple users. The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic so it is comfortable and easy to grip. It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems. I would hesitate to actually immerse the bottom of the handle, though.

It is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes; it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque. Be especially careful if you have gum recession or crowns.  Fortunately, this model warns about using too much pressure.  I find this helpful.

There is an accessory that fits over the charging base to hold extra toothbrush heads which some may find useful as well as a carrying case.  I probably wouldn't bother with the weight and bulk when traveling and will continue to carry a manual toothbrush.

No complaints at all with this toothbrush except that the handle shows water and toothpaste residue and the heads are rather costly compared to a manual toothbrush. I do think it's worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing, although the less-expensive models have the same basic features. An electric toothbrush would be especially helpful for anyone with arthritis in the hands.",A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,4.714285714285714,5.0,4.0
"Crest + Oral-B Professional Gingivitis Kit, 1 Count",5.0,"Overall, this is an amazing value and an awesome kit. The toothbrush is just wonderful and comes with plenty of heads for different cleaning/issues.. The mouthwash is a smaller sized bottle, but plenty to see if you like it and if it works well for you. Toothpaste and floss are full sized. This is a mouth transformation kit. If you have gum issues, or just want to take better care of your gums, this is the kit for you.

Previously I was using Sonicare Diamondclean and I was in love with it. Once I tried this Oral B toothbrush, I gave up on my Sonicare. I am 37, I smoke cigarettes, drink A LOT of energy drinks, and have braces. I NEED extra gum care and this toothbrush along with the mouthwash and toothpaste give me that. I would say that the toothbrush alone has made a big difference from when I was using the Sonicare.

I love that I can actually feel it working on my gums. It really feels like a gum massage. The smaller part of the head that moves separately is an awesome addition. That is where I feel the extra attention and the gum care. My teeth feel SO CLEAN after brushing with this one. I like that it is a more vigorous cleaning than with the Sonicare. It actually took me a long time to get used to the gentle cleaning that Sonicare toothbrushes give. I had been using Sonicare for about 10 years, so eventually I got used to it, although I never really did feel like they were really scrubbing as much as I liked. My teeth felt clean, but there was just something missing. This Oral B fills in the gap and gives me everything I am looking for, and then some. I just feel like my whole mouth is clean and fresh after using the Oral B.

The mouthwash is great for gums. I put some in my Waterpik (half mouthwash/half water) and I can tell a difference in the health and appearance of my gums. I do not get sore spots anymore and the sensitive areas are gone. Because of my braces, I tend to get gaps between my teeth down at the gumline. Debris get in there from eating and it can be painful and stay sore for a while. This mouthwash in the Waterpik really helps with all of the irritation.

The toothpaste is pretty good, although I think I will stick to my regular whitening toothpaste. I like a bit more bold mint flavor and I do need the whitening benefits due to cigarette smoking. Otherwise, it seems like a good toothpaste. It is a smoother mint flavor and seems to have almost a soothing effect on sore areas of the gum and mouth, so that is a plus when needed.

Mainly, I am just super impressed with the toothbrush. I had also tried the Oral B 7000 (black) but I much prefer this 5000 version. The 7000 was very impressive and the first Oral B to really make me switch from Sonicare, but just too loud. The 5000 here in this bundle just provides a better experience overall, without all of the noise. I thought the 7000 would end up being better, but it is not. It is sleek looking in black, but I just prefer the 5000 - I mean I really LOVE IT. The attention to the gums and the way it cleans so thoroughly and literally reaches every surface of the tooth, (even all around my braces!!!) is just amazing.

If you are going to invest in a good toothbrush, this is THE ONE to buy. if you need the extra gum care and attention this is the kit to buy. You can buy the toothbrush separate if you do not want all of the extra products, but for the price, you might as well get the bundle and try out the mouthwash, toothpaste and floss and see how you like them.

I do not intend to go back to Sonicare after having used this Oral B. I NEVER thought I would say that.",A1QBOC76MIOJYP,4.714285714285714,5.0,4.0
"Crest + Oral-B Professional Gingivitis Kit, 1 Count",5.0,"If my dentist offered this kit at a good price I's snap it up in a heartbeat! Or if it was a 'get all this other stuff free when you buy the toothbrush' kind of thing. It's all you need for a healthy mouth in a re-usable little tote. And if you happen to be a dentist looking at this, there is cute little 'luggage tag' attached to it that has a sleeve for your business card. In six months when your client is using the tote for groceries, they just might look at that tag and remember to make an appointment!

Now lets look at what's inside.
First, there is one of those toothbrushes that syncs with a fun little device that tells you how you're brushing. GREAT for kids, but really nice for adults, too. It will even tell you if you are brushing too hard or soft. I love it! It does everything but reach in your mouth and brush FOR you.
The included toothpaste is slightly runny for a stand-up tube, but tastes fresh.
Next there is the Crest mouthwash. They claim it doesn't sting, and they're right. The mint lasts just long enough, with some others it spoils your taste buds for hours.
Finally, some dental floss. I prefer flossing picks but it certainly completes the package.

This is a terrific promo item or gift!",A2YKWYC3WQJX5J,4.714285714285714,5.0,4.0
"Crest + Oral-B Professional Gingivitis Kit, 1 Count",5.0,"I've been a loyal Philips Sonicare user (my current model being the Sonicare Flexcare) for many years. Sonicare brushes work by emitting a sonic vibration that vibrates the bristles quickly, cleaning your teeth far more effectively than a manual toothbrush. The difference is like night and day.

My biggest gripe with my Sonicare is that sometimes it doesn't clean as effectively as I'd like right up by my gum line. I was intrigued by the rotating head on Oral B's brush, thinking that perhaps the rotating action would do a better job at cleaning these areas. I really had high hopes for this toothbrush and was excited to give it a try.

This kit includes a precision 5000 toothbrush with charger, optional brush head storage area with lid (that can be easily connected/removed to the charging base), four different brush heads, a SmartGuide device and a travel/storage case for the toothbrush. According to the manual this brush will hold a charge through 20 uses (twice per day for 10 days) so for shorter trips there's no need to bring the charger along.

My first impression of this brush is that it's heavier and more stout than my Sonicare. This isn't a complaint necessarily, just an observation. The toothbrush sets nicely on the charging base and charges with no exposed metal parts. For an item that is constantly getting wet this is a great feature.

The rotating action did actually do a better job at thoroughly cleaning my teeth than my Sonicare. Because of this action, however, the toothbrush vibrates a LOT more than my Sonicare and the vibrations are more rough. This is something that I'm getting used to though. Like my Sonicare, the toothbrush pauses and beeps when it's time to move to a new area of your mouth which is a great feature.

The SmartGuide device is really neat. It actually communicates with the toothbrush and tells you if you're pressing too hard. It also displays the quadrants of your mouth and helps guide you to which quadrant you should be brushing during each interval. Since I've been using an electric toothbrush for so many years already I don't see myself using this device very often. The toothbrush operates just fine without using the SmartGuide device which I personally appreciate.

My biggest complaint about this brush is that the shafts of the brush heads have openings in them. I'm not sure why this is but these openings allow liquefied toothpaste and whatnot to escape your mouth while brushing and it can end up on your toothbrush and/or hand. Gross. I'm sure this is one of those issues that will remedy itself as I get used to this brush but thought it was worth mentioning. My Sonicare brush has no such openings on the brush heads so I wasn't expecting this.

The items included in this kit (small bottle of mouthwash, toothpaste, and dental floss) are nice for sampling these products but don't really add much value to this kit. The bag it all came in made for a nice presentation of the product but fails to serve any purpose as soon as you unpack its contents for use. The bag is a reusable tote style bag and having one in this size has actually come in handy for other things though.

Overall I wouldn't say the kit with the small extras is worth the additional expense but the toothbrush itself is definitely worth it. Great product!",A35LT14WG5BX0T,4.714285714285714,5.0,4.0
"Crest + Oral-B Professional Gingivitis Kit, 1 Count",4.0,"This is a complete set to get you started with the Electric toothbrush (for two to share)....four brush attachments, toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss.  But the star of the kit, the best thing about it for sure, is the enclosed clock and brushing ""meter"".  What it does is keeps track of how long you brush, giving you four stars for 30 seconds on each mouth quadrant.  You can also get a fifth star (for tongue) if you go a total of 2 1/2 minutes.  For me, that's not a big deal.  But for my six year old, the stars have been a boon to getting him to brush more thoroughly.

He brushes with enthusiasm now, and I've noticed his teeth looking much cleaner than with just a brush alone.  For me, it's a helpful reminder to brush longer than I was used to.  The whole set is convenient, with a countertop charger and no batteries being required.  And having a clock in the bathroom was new to me, and very convenient.

However, two things keep me from giving it five stars.  One, the price point.  I wouldn't pay more than $50 for this set.  In all actuality, it doesn't seem worth the extremely high price point.  I mean, a Crest tote bag?  What am I going to do with that?  I don't think the set warrants the price.

The other minor point about this is you have to brush with your mouth tightly closed or you get watery toothpaste sprayed all over the mirror and counter.  Not to mention your face!  My son has to brush before he dresses or his school shirts get ruined.  So, it's a minor thing to get used to, but sort of annoying.

In all, a great set that would be better if it were more affordable.",A2LAS014NSRW72,4.714285714285714,4.0,4.0
"Crest + Oral-B Professional Daily Clean Kit, 1 Count",5.0,"This is a great way to package everything (well, almost everything) needed for dental care in a single package. It includes an Oral-B powered toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss. I'll cover each separately.

Oral-B 1000 - I have owned several Oral-B toothbrushes over the years, both basic models as well as their more advanced models. I find the 1000 series offers the best value by far. It doesn't have any of the bells and whistles as the more advanced (and much more expensive) models such as a separate display unit and multiple brushing modes, but it gets the job done and does it well. It's compact, easy to take along for travel, and simple to use.

While I've also used the Sonicare line of powered brushes, Oral-B is my favorite brand by far. I find it cleans my teeth better and the replacement heads (of which there are a variety to select from) are less expensive. My favorite heads are the Floss Action and the Extra Soft (not included in this kit - must be purchased separately). The heads in this kit (two are included - the Precision Clean and the Deep Sweep) are also good, but for my needs, not as effective as other head styles.

Toothpaste - I didn't care for the Crest toothpaste but that's due to the fact that I need to use a sensitive formulation. Other types, such as this, contribute to tooth pain for me. I didn't detract from the rating due to this since that's not a fault of the toothpaste.

Mouthwash - classic Scope. About as classic as you can get. Simple, tastes good, works well.

Floss - my usual brand is the Oral-B regular Glide so it was interesting to compare it with this version (the ""Pro-Health""). The Pro-Health seems to be thicker and more durable than the regular, but I can't say that it cleaned any better. Any version of Glide is, in my opinion, far better than any other floss if you have tightly spaced teeth. It gets between my teeth far more easily and comfortably than any other brand.

Overall, a great dental health kit that comes packed in a nice (but somewhat smallish) tote bag. Highly recommend!",A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,4.75,5.0,4.0
"Crest + Oral-B Professional Daily Clean Kit, 1 Count",5.0,"I have a small bathroom counter, so there is little space for extra gadgets.  This toothbrush doesn't take up a lot of space, as the base is relatively small.  It fits easily in the corner of my counter.

It took over 8 hours to fully charge it the first time, but once it is charged, you can leave it resting on the charger when you aren't using it.  I love the small brush attachment, because I have a small mouth, and the bigger attachments don't work as well for me.  I have used a Sonic Care in the past, and I didn't care for the size of the brush and the charger was really big.  The Sonic Care tickled my mouth and if I barely pulled it out of my mouth, toothpaste sprayed all over my mirror.  That doesn't happen with this one, because the brush is small and easier to maneuver.  The only thing I think it's missing is a toothbrush cover for the brush.

Every 30 seconds, it beeps so you can change locations.  I brush the top outside, when it beeps, I switch to the top inside, etc.  It turns off when it is finished.  I like how it stops if you are brushing too hard.  This is very helpful, as I tend to do that.  I just recently had gum graft surgery for recession, and I am now very aware of how hard I am brushing now, so that I don't destroy my gums again.

You can buy larger brush attachments for this, and it comes with one.  I haven't used that one, as I prefer the size of the smaller one.

Note, this is not a waterpick.  There is no water to deal with...a nice change from the '70s when everyone had waterpiks spraying around.  But, it's not the neatest thing to use...you get toothpaste sprayed around the room if you aren't careful.

"Crest + Oral-B Professional Whitening Kit, 1 Count",4.0,"I give the Whitening Kit four stars because it worked as advertised- my teeth were noticeably whiter after application.  The MSRP of the kit value is also less than the sum of the retail values of the individual parts.  I've deducted one star because it caused tooth pain during usage.  Additionally, only a few elements of the kit are actually needed for whitened teeth.

First, a few thoughts.

- The Oral-B 4000 took somewhere between 24-48 hours to get a full charge!
  * I liked the brushing feature wherein the toothbrush stops during operation to remind you to switch quadrants.
  * Nice of them to include two extra brushing tips in the kit.

- The white strips worked noticeably better than the ones I last used.  They're a neater affair these days.
  * I no longer foamed at the mouth and took on the appearance of a rabid dog.

- You can probably achieve just as good (and cheaper!) results using only the white strips and the toothpaste.

USAGE LOG:

Day 1: I'm not a heavy coffee or tea drinker, but I did have some yellow stains on the lower portions of my teeth.  Started the kit in earnest, although I decided not to use the white rinse because I didn't like the after-taste.

Day 2: My teeth were already one shade whiter!  However, the Oral-B 4000 was causing tooth-root-pain so I switched to manual brushing with the whitening toothpaste.

Days 3 - 12: Used the white strips/manual brushing + whitening toothpaste.  Very pleased with the results.  Mild, but tolerable tooth pain.

Took a break for Halloween and consumed candy which may have set back some of my whitening progress.

Days 13 - 14: Teeth look much whiter.  Even the hard-to-reach-side-teeth look brighter as well, due wholly to the whitening toothpaste.

CONCLUSION: I think the entire kit is unnecessary.  It certainly worked as advertised, but you can achieve the same results with just the whitening strips + whitening toothpaste, without the whitening rinse and electric toothbrush.",A3EFSLEMHNPP6A,4.5,4.0,4.0
"Crest + Oral-B Professional Whitening Kit, 1 Count",5.0,"As a coffee-drinker, I'm constantly looking for whitening treatments that work, yet don't cost too much money. I get free whitening from my dentist that doesn't whiten my teeth evenly, and I'm wondering if it's hurting my enamel. This kit claims it's safe for your enamel. And it works great. The kit comes in a handy bag that fits all the products. The kit also includes two whitening toothpastes, an electronic toothbrush with 3 different replaceable heads (and a base to hold the extras), and a pack of 14-day whitening strips. I love the whitestrips - they certainly work. Though, as a coffee drinker, it's a constant process. So I really appreciated the electric toothbrush and whitening toothpaste. The settings are very handy, and it works extremely well. I'll be getting a LOT of use out of this kit.",A24ZMNWTW8AQUR,4.5,5.0,4.0

"Fleece Ear Warmers Headband for Men &amp; Women, Thermal Polar Ear Muffs Warmers Keep You Warm and Cozy for Daily Wear, Sports, Running, Skiing and More",5.0,"I've recently been on the warpath for something to fight my middle-aged (okay, just aged) acne that has popped up to join my wrinkles, age spots, and gray hair.

I have to say first that I am not an experienced user of either cosmetics or products claiming to clear your skin. That said, I have found that rose oil water is effective at shortening the life of some of my acne. I think THIS product is actually either eliminating some blackheads, or at least making my pores smaller. And it smells and feels really good when you use it. Very pleasant texture somewhere between a mud mask and extremely fine exfoliant. It doesn't dry out my skin and I live in an extremely dry high desert climate, but it isn't oily, either.

You have to put it on after you wash your face, and then wait a few minutes, which does add time to my morning routine of washing my face and then just heading out the door. But I believe it is worth it

Be realistic in your expectation of any face products, none of them can give you skin like Nicole Kidman. I'm still breaking out with my annoying 'spots' but this product does seem to make my pores less conspicuous, which for me is quite an achievement.

I was give a sample of this to use and provide a review.",A1ZH5ULI4SBO48,4.5,5.0,4.0
"Fleece Ear Warmers Headband for Men &amp; Women, Thermal Polar Ear Muffs Warmers Keep You Warm and Cozy for Daily Wear, Sports, Running, Skiing and More",5.0,"First and foremost, I received this product for free to review by the company. Since I have already fallen in love with their mask/scrub ""Get Refreshed"",  I had high hopes for this. Luckily, I wasn't disappointed. I must also point out that I have very oily skin that also has the tendency of being very sensitive. Things can break me out in a heartbeat so I'm always very cautious. Despite this company using oils in their line, they seem to use oils that are safe for acne prone skin.

Many people with oily skin stay away from products containing oils however, this is not a good idea. Yes, certain oils can wreak havoc for us but that's only if they're not the right ones. We needs moisture just like everyone else. Avoiding oil based products is a myth and can lead to your skin becoming more imbalanced. And if that's not bad enough, premature aging.

Now for my assessment. More Than Clean is really impressive. The product is like a greenish color, smells awesome and is thick consistency. Though it's a cleanser, don't expect it to foam or soap up like a traditional one. A little goes a long way and you use it on damp skin. I rub it in and let it sit for a 3 minutes before washing it off in order for it to penetrate. After washing it off with lukewarm water, it's amazing. It leaves my skin feeling tingly and really clean. I get absolutely no shine despite my face feeling lightly moisturized.

Yesterday, I used it with my Clarisonic Mia and got even BETTER RESULTS! I haven't used it long enough to have pore shrinkage though. One thing I do notice is that my skin feels tighter but not in a dried out way. It's like the same feeling you get after a really great facial at the spa. I'll keep using and update on pore shrinkage because I do have a a problem area which is my nose (especially the sides).

Benefits of the main Ingredients:

Peppermint: It contains menthol that nourishes dull skin and boosts the texture of oily skin. This oil is best to keep your pimples at bay and your face blemish-free.

Lavender: Benefits include that of being antiseptic and anti-fungal which helps to reduce scarring and speeds healing. The essential oil is also an anti-inflammatory and circulatory stimulant.

Apricot Kernels: Apricot kernel seed & it's oil gently moisturizes skin. It's used to moisturize balanced skin, oily skin and hormone reactive skin.

Sage: Assists in improving acne, chapped skin, and relieving symptoms of eczema and psoriasis. It is soothing to acne-prone skin and a refreshing toner.",A2CQ2X9H9HY6W0,4.5,5.0,4.0
"Fleece Ear Warmers Headband for Men &amp; Women, Thermal Polar Ear Muffs Warmers Keep You Warm and Cozy for Daily Wear, Sports, Running, Skiing and More",4.0,"This is one of the most unique, refreshing, organic cleansers I've ever used. It is truly a thrill every time I wash my face. Afterwards, my skin feels so soft pliable. Not over dried and taut like most soaps. I truly appreciate the natural ingredients and lack of artificial fragrance. There is a distinct scent - it smells deliciously green and minty - but you can tell it's from the ingredients, not some harsh synthetic.

Unfortunately I haven't noticed a huge change in the quantity of blackheads on my skin or a reduction in pores, so I can't exactly call it a miracle product. The directions suggest using it once a day, every morning. I have been following that routine pretty well (it's the perfect cleanser to wake you up and make you feel refreshed) but I continue to use my more powerful cleanser at night since I have acne-prone skin. This seems to work out nicely. Personally I would recommend this product more for aging skin or those who do not have to worry about breakouts. I don't think it would CAUSE breakouts, but it doesn't prevent them from happening either, so unfortunately I have to keep up with my harsher stuff.

OVERALL: If you're sick of having painfully dry skin after washing your face, give this a try. It is super gentle, super hydrating, and makes you feel like heaven hours after the last splash of water. The bottle is fairly small, but it lasts a long time. I give it an above-average recommendation.",AY6A8KPYCE6B0,4.5,4.0,4.0
"Fleece Ear Warmers Headband for Men &amp; Women, Thermal Polar Ear Muffs Warmers Keep You Warm and Cozy for Daily Wear, Sports, Running, Skiing and More",5.0,"More Than Clean is a combination scrub and masque recommended for morning use.  You work it into your skin for a couple of minutes, then leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing it off.  There are no unpronounceable ingredients in it, and it smells like peppermint.  It's a very thick bilious colored liquid dispensed through the bottle cap.  I've used it four times with great results on my skin and one unexpected but welcome side effect.

The MTC initially feels like mud, but there's a really refreshing tingle that's just great first thing in the morning.  If you're of the generation that used a product called Seabreeze, that's exactly the sensation, only stronger.  The tingle doesn't go away until the stuff is rinsed off, either, and skin feels really clean.  I have some large pores around my nose, and they're thoroughly flattened by
this stuff.

If you have dry skin, go easy with this, and use a good moisturizer afterwards.  I have an oily T Zone with dry cheeks, and have learned to concentrate on my oily areas with the MTC, with just a quick once over on the dryer areas of my face.  I've been using this just before showering in the morning, and then using the shower to rinse it off--and here's the unexpected side effect: my miserable early spring sinuses have improved!  I think it's the herbs in the product coupled with the steam from the shower, but my whole sinus area feels SO much more open.  Hooray!

I'm thrilled with this product.  My skin feels awake and energized, and the products I use daily--serums, moisturizer, and BB cream--just sink right in after use.  I was provided a bottle of More Than Clean for review, and am delighted to do so.  I really like the effect on my skin, and love breathing easier.  Win all around!",A1M1Y5UGONAW06,4.5,5.0,4.0

PROS

Crest Pro-Health For Life CPC Antigingivitis/Antiplaque Smooth Mint Rinse 33.8 Fl Oz,2.0,"At first taste, the Crest Pro-Health for old folks seems pretty good.  There's no alcohol and consequently there is none of the tingly sensation some of us are accustomed to.

After using it, your breath is definitely minty fresh... BUT there's a weird chemical after-taste that lasts and lasts; which my husband and myself found to be unpleasant.

On the non-pro-health side, it's a chemical concoction.  It contains ""propylparaben"" which is know to mimic estrogen.  It also contains Red 33, which can be found in Cutex Nail Polish remover.

Now really, given that we are adults-over-50, can't we just have clear mouth wash.  Or whatever color the Cetylpyridinium Chloride gives the liquid.  Because that's the only active ingredient: Cetylpyridinium Chloride.  (also used in some pesticides because it fights fungus.)

It is a subtle mint flavor, yet still leaves your mouth feeling fresh. ""Smooth"" fits the flavor/strength perfectly. It is not harsh at all, but still effective.

This mouthwash claims to help with inflammation and soreness of the gums. I'd say this claim is true. I wear braces and do get inflamed/sore gums from time to time. Crest Pro-Health For Life has helped with that. It actually soothes the gums. The inflammation goes away much quicker.

I used this in my WaterPik with great results as well. Normally, I fill it up half way with warm water and the rest of the way with Listerine.

I did ask my orthodontist about using this mouthwash, if it would be beneficial to me in regards to the gum issues, since this product is meant for people over 50 years of age - I am only 36. He said it definitely could not hurt to try and would probably work well since it is made for gum issues. He told me to let him know how it goes.

[Etude House] Lip Perfume,1.0,If you're looking for a perfect nude lip then this is the way to go. If you're looking for a lip stick base then this is not it.  While your lip color may adhere to this concealer it will lighten it a lot. Again that may be good if that's what you're looking for.

[Etude House] Lip Perfume,4.0,"This is going to sound really stupid, but I could never figure out why certain shades of pink lipstick never looked the same on my lips as they did in arm swatches. I really never connected the thing is that I have pigmented lips, and because they pull red, any color always has a reddish cast to it. And definitely no pink lipstick, especially anything lighter than medium, ever looked right.

I started looking around to see if there was some product I could use, since foundation is just drying and causes flaking. I was told that MAC makes a good lip coverup, but it's $20 (why is everything at MAC $20 and up?) I don't have a problem spending the money, but since there's no freestanding MAC store near me, I thought I'd give this Etude House concealer a try.

And it's good. Unlike plain foundation, it's very glossy when you first apply it. It truly blots out your real lip color; it's like lip White-Out. In a mirror, you look like you're looking at a photo negative!

This stuff is way too glossy to put anything over it without blotting. The dry down takes forever without blotting, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that once I blotted, the white out effect was still very much there, just not glossy, and so, ready for lipstick. The one thing it does really well  is block out the red of my lips and give my lip products a much truer color payoff.

I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out. The only caution I'd say is you don't need to put on as much of this as I did; you'll just be wasting product, and there's no dry down when you overdo it!",A2JCJJNY43QQIV,3.6,4.0,4.0

"Toni&amp;Guy Glamour Volume Plumping Whip, 2.82 Fluid Ounce",5.0,"Over the last 52 years I have made demands on my body and backed it up with miracle products. I want my tummy flat and my hair poofy, somehow my body got confused - with opposite results, so I have flat, yet still frizzy, hair. In the meantime I'm at that ""I need a haircut"" stage where I'm not sure what I want to do with it, so it's sort of half grown out, not long enough for headbands or to hold back, not short enough to really be a style, just unmanageable.

I decided what the heck and tried some Toni&guy plumping whip to see if I could whip it back into shape. The whip is a semi solid, sort of like coconut oil texture when it gets cool. The scent is very light and doesn't really smell of anything, no floral or perfume smell. The directions say to use a walnut size scoop, but since my hair is short I used about half that. Towel dry, scoop, put on hair, run through, dry. Easy enough, the whip didn't feel heavy on my fingers or hair, it rubbed through easily and I got out my blow dryer and went to work.

The crown and top of my hair plumped right up, and styled easily. I blew it flat by the ears so it wouldn't stick out and that worked too, so if you're doing a convoluted have lift half flat style this will work just fine. There is no residue feeling when I run my hand through my hair, and the volume probably increased by a good half.

I'm very pleased with the Tono&Guy (Liked the shampoo too, but that's another review) and my plump hair, now if my tummy would just get the memo I'd be set.",A3AZI828WJN1CD,3.5,5.0,4.0

Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of whip in the small jar, so I wasted quite a bit practicing with it. I'll definitely buy another jar, though, because I like the results.

"Toni&amp;Guy Glamour Volume Plumping Whip, 2.82 Fluid Ounce",4.0,"This looks like a cold cream when you open the jar.  It's just a bit thinner than a cream like that.  You towel dry your hair, then apply it at the roots.  As it dries, it gives you a bit of root stiffies that actually plumps the hair up away from the head, so it adds some volume and thickness.  It works a bit like a mousse, but is a good bit stronger than that.
I didn't like the way my hair felt though.  Even after brushing, my hair felt a bit dirty, like it does with heavier products.
It smells nice, but the scent wasn't very strong and was rather nondescript to me.  I suspect it might work best on shorter hair that needs a lot of volume and a more sculpted look.

I started with a very small amount because I do know that my hair is thin; regardless of the amount used, the same effect was -begrudgingly achieved!  It did tame fly-away hairs but then it looked and felt greasy.  As far as bounce and plumping qualities they were not anymore prevalent than when I ordinarily wash my and style my hair that first day.

Do not recommend this product for thin hair.  Felt as if I was applying cream to my hair and expecting a miracle.  There is no way that thinner hair can have a thick cream based product applied and expected to be bouncy and volume-ized.

I have shoulder length, thin, flat, professionally colored/highlighted hair.  I was expecting a very light product because of the whip name, but it wasn't. It was thicker than a mousse, but lighter than a cream. It does have a nice texture and scent. They recommend using a walnut size amount. That may work for thicker hair. I found the more I used, the more I felt like I had a heavy hair product on my roots, even when my hair was dry. This product did not add any extra volume to my flat hair than a normal blow dry would. It does control fly away hair. Even on a second day blow out, it still kept the fly aways under control.

I would recommend this product depending on your hair texture and needs. Right now it's winter where I live and the temperature has been low twenties. Which means lots of static and fly away hair. So I have been using this product, just in smaller amounts than recommended.",A10ZBR6O8S8OCY,3.5,4.0,4.0

And, I must agree with several reviewers who sagely noted that the components of the product are less-than-healthy. The first two times I tried the whip, I quickly washed my hands afterward. Of course, logically, it was still in my hair ... and near/on my scalp. Ultimately, this made me way too nervous to continue to use it, so I tossed it.

Luckily, I read the back before even hopping into the shower.  Now, I think the scent may be polarizing. For me, it translated as ""pleasant"" and ""clean"" (I thought it smelled like a blend of citrus and mint, which I found to be a very refreshing fragrance). I think because I gravitate towards the uncommon, this registered as very likeable. Now, I definitely used WAY too much the first time. (I think I just enjoyed the texture and the experience. LOL!) So, just be careful of that. Finally, it is easy to distribute and rinsed super clean. My only concern is any potential rust from the canister. I usually leave my shampoo and conditioner in the shower area ... but I was worried that this container could stain my tub/shower (I had done this accidentally with a shave cream many years ago). So, I find myself taking this into the shower and carrying it out of the shower ... and occasionally forgetting it, wrapping a towel around me and going to grab it. I guess, I'm flummoxed by metal containers in the shower.

A style that needs a lot of body and not be weighed down by heavy products, or else I don't get the desired effect.

But that's not how this product is designed to work. It's supposed to be washed out in the shower. This works very well for making hair soft but light and fluffy. And it really worked well for my teen daughter, who has very fine thin hair. Normally she can't use any conditioner in her hair. She's at an age where her hair is getting very oily every single day, and already having very fine thin hair, the two are a bad combination. So she has to use clarifying shampoo every day, and no conditioner, just to keep her hair nice.

This conditioner however is so light and washes away well in the shower, that she can use it to help soften her hair without completely weighing it down and adding to her oily hair issues.

I love the fragrance which smells like fresh grapefruit and citrus. It's very natural scent, not like something cooked up in a lab. It's one of my favorite things about the product.

"Beauty Aura 100% Pure Avocado Oil - 16 Fl Oz - For Healthy Hair, Skin &amp; Nails.",5.0,"I am always nervous when I order a big bottle of oil over the internet, so much can go wrong! However, I had nothing to fear here, this was packaged superbly, well wrapped and with a secondary seal on the inner cap to prevent leakage, and in an external bag as well, just for safetys sake. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.

Having read about the amazing qualities of avocado oil for the skin and hair, I was very excited to try this. I immediately opened it up to try, first off, it does not have any sort of offensive odor, it is extremely neutral, which I found pleasant. I suspect it would work well as a carrier for other essentials if desired, though I haven't tried that yet. I have very dry hands, and tested it there first, and felt it quickly absorb, my cuticles have felt better all afternoon!

After my bath this evening I used it as an after shower moisturiser, and feel so luxurious. It absorbs quickly into the skin, and doesnt feel greasy so much as it feels like a heavy lotion on the skin. I am excited to continue using this product, being a nerd I looked up some science, and learned that Avocado Oil is supposed to have something called sterolin in it, which I haven't heard of previously, but is helpful for spots and softening of the skin, I believe the softening part, and will be using it on my feet before bed tonight.

Mixing just a drop or two before applying does wonders. Both my mom and I have sensitive skin and have had zero problems with this. I'm happy to see it on Amazon:)",A6OFD9EMNRTXF,5.0,5.0,4.0

"Acne Scar Reducing Cream, All Natural w/ Tomato,Cucumber &amp; Fenugreek, 2 oz, By Diva Stuff",5.0,"Purchase this for one of my son's who has some major scars from acne and having cystic acne as well .He had to have surgery months ago to remove some that  were close to his eye. While we are thrilled that problem is settled he was left with some pretty big scars that were giving him a complex. After trying several scar creams with no results we decided to give this a try .This has worked great ,his scars are still there but not as noticeable as they were .The color is also fading as well. On one particular scar he did use this but also used rosehip oil at night before bed and wow what a difference with the combination of the two products. Of couse Rosehip oil is pretty strong scent wise he only used it at bedtime. Had this for a while now and while I agree with some reviewers the scent is not the greatest ,it has worked for him .He uses three times a day. So far no one has complained or gagged at the scent. It's worth a try especially when all else fails .",AENH50GW3OKDA,5.0,5.0,4.0
Shiseido beauty up cotton makeup cotton 108 pieces,5.0,"I use these for wicking, and have been very pleased with the performance. My normal go-to brand has been Koh Gen Do (sp?) or Muji, but these outperform both those brands. The pads are a bit thinner than KGD or Muji, so you do need to use a little more, but the performance more than makes up for that. This wicks faster and holds more liquid, which makes it perfect for lower ohm builds on RTAs and RDTAs when you need the wick to perform as good as possible.  The thinner nature also makes this ideal for creating a Scottish roll wick for RDAs.

This is the same as the Shiseido pads that come in the plastic bags. This comes in a cardboard box, and is meant for sale in Japan, but the actual pads are identical to the ones in the plastic bag. Check both options to see which is the better value since pricing can vary considerably.",A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,5.0,5.0,4.0

"Philips Sonicare Sonic Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush for Kids, HX6311/07",5.0,"We have been using the regular Sonicares for adults for a while now and decided to get this for the younger kids in our house. The pulse rate is can be chosen between high and low (for less vibration). The major difference is in the size of the brush heads and the body diameter and weight, making it more comfortable for kids to handle it. These also pause with a beep reminder every thirty seconds to remind the user the switch quadrants...until all four quadrants are cleaned and then stops at two minutes, unless of course, you push the start button once more. This comes with appliques for girls and boys so they can customize the look of the faceplate if they wish to (a pink one and a blue one). In short, this is a full Sonicare just sized smaller in every way to make it more comfortable for kids aged four and up to use. Having said that, even adults who prefer small brush heads might want to consider this version. Also great for travel, since this is lighter and smaller. Recommended.",AF5AJ5V9T6LTS,5.0,5.0,4.0

"Home Health Evercln, Face Cream, 1.69 Fluid Ounce",3.0,"This may be suitable for some people but it is not really what I need in an eye cream.

Here are the ingredients since the listing on the product page seems to cut off:

Water, caprylic/capric triglyceride, glyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, PEG-100 stearate, dimethicone, stearic acid, cetearyl glucoside, tocopherol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, lavender flower extract, camellia sinensis leaf extract, grape seed oil, bisabolol, jojoba seed oil, sodium hyaluronate, panthenol, PEG/PPG-4/12 dimethicone, silica, xanthan gum, phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, aminomethyl propanol.

There is nothing in here that really makes it any more special than an average facial moisturizer.  It has some moisturizing ingredients (caprylic/capric triglycerides, glycerin, aloe, sodium hyaluronate, grapeseed oil, jojoba oil).  It has some antioxidants (from the tea leaf extract).  The moisturizing effects may help diminish the appearance of fine lines; hyaluronate, for example, holds on to a lot of water and may have a plumping effect.  I don't have much in the way of fine lines, but I am not really seeing a difference in the ones I do have after applying this every morning for awhile now.

For what it's worth, this does have some silicones in it.

If you have really sensitive eyes and can't use most other eye creams, this could be an option for you.  It is non-irritating, even when used on sensitive/thin skin.  I have been using this in the morning before putting in my contact lenses and it doesn't bother my eyes at all.  You don't need a lot at once so one container will last a long time, making this a pretty good value.

But, in the end, I feel like this is not the eye cream for me.  I am looking for something with a few more active ingredients designed specifically for the eye area.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,3.0,3.0,4.0

"E.l.f. Moisturizing Lipstick Ravishing Rose, 0.11 Ounce",4.0,"I have tried several of Burt's Bees lip colors in various forms, Lemongrass lipstick, Lotus and now this E.l.f. lipstick. All around Lotus WAS one of my favorites, but when I started to reorder I saw comments that the company has changed the formula and that it is no longer organic and may even contain lead. Lotus is also much higher priced than this E.l.f product (I paid the"" add on"" price of just over $2). I thought, ""I can't beat that price, even it turns out I don't like it."" For the price I probably should give it 5 stars but I'm not fond of this color, it is rose as it states but it is much lighter than I expected. I also think I'll have to apply it frequently. It feels GREAT on though. It's very moisturizing. I will try another color, hopefully one that is darker. I like the ""coffee"", deep burgundy colors better. I kinda knew from the picture that I might think this one was too light for my liking so I'm not complaining just giving my honest opinion. I want to say that I love it, but I honestly can't. Maybe I'll love the next color (which I will try), but even then it'll have to prove to have better staying power before I'll be able to say I love it. :-)  As a side note: Burt Bees shimmer lip balm is another favorite, when I find the right color, in part for it's staying power.

"BMC Nail Stamping Lacquers - Creative Art Polish Collection, 6 Colors: Set 1",4.0,"-Edited to add a star, because I've now used the white on an actual nail and it did better than anticipated.-
This is OK nail polish, but I bought it because the description said it was good for stamping, so I thought it would give me really better results than the regular (mostly Wet and Wild) polishes I have been using so far. The black does seem more opaque and with it I got swatches I am quite happy with. The gold is brighter yellow, and perhaps a little more opaque than my current polish. The silver also seemed to work well. But after swatching on paper, I'm pretty sure the red and blue would only show up on a really light base color. The white showed up somewhat on top of darker colors, but didn't particularly stand out. I was able to get nice crisp images with all of the colors, so points for that. For what it's worth, the polish isn't particularly thick.and dries fairly quickly.  All in all, I'm fairly happy with the black, gold and silver, less so with the white, and least of all with the red and blue. I expect I will come up with uses for them, they just aren't quite what I was hoping for.

I will say that the shipment came in good time and was very well and securely packaged, points to the seller for that.",A1VUXNNB1NJ2PT,4.1,4.0,4.0

Alaffia - Beautiful Curls - Curl Reviving Tonic - 12 oz (FFP),1.0,"I just bought a bottle of this from Whole Foods. I noticed that the Alaffia people have added phenoxyethanol to this product. It did not
used to be in curl reviving tonic. I am surprised and disappointed that they put it in.  It is known to be toxic. I wrote the company and told
them my feelings about this. If many people would complain, they would probably take it out.
See the following for a commentary.

Phenoxyethanol is a glycol ether. Glycols are a series of chemicals that find their way into all sorts of things: paint, lacquer, jet fuel..... Phenoxyethanol is used as an anti-bacterial in cosmetics as well as a stabilizer in perfume.

The product's Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) says that it phenoxyethanol is harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin and that it can cause reproductive damage. The MSDS refers to 100% concentrations, so is it safe at lower doses? In cosmetics the concentrations are typically 0.5% to 1%.

There are several animal studies that demonstrate that it is toxic - with effects on the brain and the nervous system - at moderate concentrations. In Japan, there is a concentration limit for its use in cosmetics. In Europe, the European Union classifies it as an irritant and there are various studies (on rabbit skin, for example) that demonstrate reactions at low doses. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) data sheets show chromosomal changes and genetic mutation effects in testing as well as testicular atrophy and interference with reproductivity in mice.

I also came across a report written by a medical professional who contracted allergies after coming into contact with phenoxyethanol in a detergent used for cleaning lab equipment.  It seems he wasn't a fluke. There are over 3,000 known allergans and they were studied, along with the data from 9,948 patients, by a research team in Germany. Phenoxyethanol was in the top 10. An Italian study also determined that phenoxyethanol is a contact allergan. However, a 1990 article in the Journal of the American College of Toxicology said that it was only a mild irritant to rabbit skin at 2%.

Concern that phenoxyethanol is a neurotoxin precedes the FDA. German research in 1999, concluded that it had neurotoxin potential.

Phenoxyethanol breaks down to phenol and acetaldehyde, acetaldehyde converts to acetate. Phenol can disable the immune system's primary response mechanism. Given that, it is at best ironic, that phenoxyethanol is used as an anti-bacterial in vaccines. Acetaldehyde occurs during the breakdown of ethanol, (alchohol and 2-phenoxyETHANOL), it is a suspected carcinogen. Inhalation studies have shown irritation of the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract.",AHS5D14VLYIKE,1.0,1.0,4.0
"Physicians Formula Luxury Eye Cream for Normal to Dry Skin 0.5 oz, 14 g (2 pack)",5.0,I love this product and most of Physicians Formula products.  I have used this product for years and years and hope to keep using them.,A2MB2E1ZEJJGWJ,5.0,5.0,4.0
"Physicians Formula Luxury Eye Cream for Normal to Dry Skin 0.5 oz, 14 g (2 pack)",5.0,"Tried it once before I tossed it...and now it's the only one I use.

I have very dry skin and make up crepes under my eyes as a result.  Yes, I've tried many other creams (specifically, every one olay has ever come out with); I've also tried setting it with different powders after watching youtube videos.  For me, powder was the worst choice.

Since most beauty products cater to oily or combination skin,  I imagine that those of us with truly dry skin are more of a minority and so it's reasonable that this won't work for a lot of people.

But if you're like me and you could probably cover your face in olive oil and think, ""damn, now my skin looks nice"", this might be for you.  It is truly the only thing I've used that doesn't make my concealer or foundation crepe.

One reviewer compared it to Vaseline, which it is definitely not.  However, I can see where she was coming from.  It's thick and oily and just what my skin needs.  It also lasts longer than any dermatologist would recommend keeping it for.  I finally threw my first jar out after 6 months because eyeshadow fell in it, and it still looked almost as full as the first day I bought it.",A1EQRBC7NB1YAN,5.0,5.0,4.0
Essential Makeup Brush Set - With Makeup Brush Holder - Leather Carrying Case 12 Professional Quality Brushes,5.0,"Very nice set of brushes! This comes with a complete set of brushes all with different shapes and sizes for different purposes. It has all kinds of different brushes for any need you have. This set will help you to get the look that want when applying your makeup. They all have long smooth handles and the brushes are very soft. I love the blush brush a lot and the angled eyeliner brush. It helps to blend in my eyeliner so it looks more natural. In addition to the makeup brushes, you also get the brush holder, which helps to keep all your brushes neat and organized all together. It also is easy to travel with because you just put one of the cylinder holders on top of the other with all your brushes inside and woolah. They can easily travel with you. Now you can always have all your makeup brushes together when you travel. This was a great idea and I love that. None of the brushes will ever be squished or lost in this cylinder case. The makeup brushes stay protected.

This also looks quite nice on your dresser or in your bathroom; wherever it is you apply your makeup. The leather pink cylinder cases are cute and attractive and hold all the brushes nicely. In addition, if you have to move your makeup brushes daily because you don't have enough room to keep them out when you do your makeup they are very easy to move around because of the nice leather cases this comes with. Just pop the lid of one case onto the other case and they are protected from dust and the little pink case looks like a decorative item. I was so excited to buy this product with a discount for an honest review and I could not be more pleased with it. Highly recommended makeup brush set with case!",A1BRCVMQ7C9CGJ,5.0,5.0,4.0
Essential Makeup Brush Set - With Makeup Brush Holder - Leather Carrying Case 12 Professional Quality Brushes,5.0,"&nbsp;This review is for the Essential Makeup Brush Set - With Makeup Brush Holder - Leather Carrying Case 12 Professional Quality Brushes.

This is a BEAUTIFUL brush set with 12 different options for putting on makeup. I was surprised by how large the set was when it arrived in the mail. The brushes came nestled in a container and each brush was individually wrapped. The brushes are truly lovely.

Each brush is light pink with pink metal and ultra-soft bristles. The brushes apply makeup without any streaks or lines. The ends are so soft and high quality that it picks up my makeup perfectly and goes on smooth. There are several different brushes for mineral make up powder (which I use), contouring, eye makeup, eyebrow makeup and lips! I find that it applies my face powder which is mineral powder perfectly and quickly and the makeup doesn't fall off the brushes and get all over.

The container is high quality synthetic leather and light pink much like the rest of the set. It is great for travel or displaying your brushes. I set it on my counter and it keeps my brushes nice and safe. I love this set! 5/5 stars for value, quality and design!

If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a discounted promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.",AOADTSGQ0CULN,5.0,5.0,4.0

"Im Natural Mamey Mascara (Value Pack of 8), Length and Volume for Super Long Lashes Guaranteed!",5.0,"I have never heard of Mamey Oil until I was given the opportunity to try this mascara. I am in my mid forty and it seems everything is either dropping or falling out, and that includes my eyelashes. I hardly ever wear makeup anymore except for moisturizer on my face since I have permanent eyeliner tattooed on my eye lids. I just do no like that heavy caked on makeup look.

IM Natural Mamey Mascara goes on light and dries flake free. Makes my lashes look natural and not like thick black spider legs or like I am going out for the night. Best of all it washes of so easily. However, I do wish the brush was longer and not so short and fat.

In regards to Mamey Oil, it comes from the Mamey fruit that grows in Mexico, Central America, Caribbean and south Florida to name a few. It has an excellent source of vitamin C, and B6, as well as a good source of vitamin E, potassium and copper. Besides being different ways to consume it, it can be used for hair and scalp and now proven to help thicken, strengthen and help grow longer lashes. Perfect match for me and my falling eyelashes.

I have only been using this mascara for a short period of time and I quickly noticed less lashes on my bosom or in my eyeballs. So yes I am a believer that it does help strengthen eyelashes. In regards to helping grow longer, only time will tell. I can tell you that this mascara does not clump and goes on light and not heavy.

Incredibly it is an 8 pack box so it should last you a long time.

"Im Natural Mamey Mascara (Value Pack of 8), Length and Volume for Super Long Lashes Guaranteed!",4.0,"I wear mascara for special occasions, but my two daughters wear it daily so I was pleased to accept a complimentary sample of IM Natural Mamey mascara for testing and review purposes. I wasn't familiar with mamey seed oil, but a quick Internet search showed that the oil from mamey seeds ""is rich in vitamins A, B, C and E, proteins, amino acids, fatty acids and minerals. It serves as a great moisturizer for dry skin and is known as a hair revitalizer"" and ""helps stimulate follicles to encourage growth and helps nourish your hair from the root to help it look healthier"". That sounds like a great ingredient to have in mascara - but will it be waterproof and make lashes look great?

I'm happy to report that the mascara IS waterproof, applies smoothly without clumps, and makes lashes look long, natural and defined. None of us had any allergic reaction to it after wearing it for a couple of days, and the description on Amazon says it's all-natural. The only thing we didn't like was the wand, which is a large conical brush. It takes a little getting used to, but we managed to apply the mascara without putting out an eye or over-applying the product.

With 8 tubes in this box, this is enough mascara to last a long time or to share with friends. It's a bargain when you compare the price to a single tube of drug store or makeup counter mascara.",AEC90GPFKLAAW,4.5,4.0,4.0

Lice Shield Sh 2-1 Size 10z,3.0,"When it has came down to hair conditions, we often want the best in protection. Sometime, lice and bedbugs can be a very serious medical condition, and it sometimes takes much more than meets the eye to really hit the nail on the head at wanting the best in protection. Lice Shield is a specialty shampoo and conditioner in one pack that claims to be worth its money, but in long term, it actually doesn't do the job at bringing out the best in protection after a few uses. It might be good only in small cases, but if you have had long and difficult cases at getting rid of those pesky problems, it can be better if stronger. It does leave a noble scent, but honestly more could have been brought n to make it more long lasting. I would recommend it for only minor lice cases, but honestly you are just better off going somewhere else for extra protection.

"180 Cosmetics Cellulite Reducing Solution, Orange Peel, 5.1 Oz",5.0,"Similar in texture and in effectiveness to the Cellulite Reducing Solution by the same brand, this cream is designed to target any body area that could be firmer, smoother, less wrinkly (if your problem area is the chest, there is a more specific product called Breast Firming Solution).  I accepted to test this cream for review purposes with more curiosity than high expectations because my target area is notoriously tough to improve.  I had gained weight and then finally lost some, and was doing my best with exercise and my Slendertone belt, but as long as that little cushion of fat remained over my stomach, I could never see the full impact of my efforts.

That's where this cream comes in.  My stomach problem was not really cellulite but a different type of subcutaneous fat and very difficult to shift.  I must stress that, good as the cream is, it takes time to see results.  It will not magically melt away fatty bulges, it will not reduce your waistline measurement all by itself, and it does not claim to remove stretch marks, but it will improve the elasticity and tone of your skin.  It can make all the difference when your shape is improving, but the skin texture lets you down.  Loose, wrinkly skin is so ageing, as much on the body as it is on the face, but specialist creams like this one are difficult to find.  I'm very glad I gave this a try because the improvement, once it starts to show, is very pleasing.

The cream comes in a medium-sized soft tube (150 ml) and has a fairly thick consistency.  It becomes very white as you spread it, and stays creamy for a while, allowing a good, long massage, which also helps.  Once absorbed, there is no residue.  Among the main active ingredients are caffeine, Vitamin C, carnitine, and algae extracts. It smells deliciously of essential oils and, like the rest of the 180 Cosmetics range, it is a natural product without any toxic chemical additives.  All their products are also cruelty-free, and not tested on animals.

So, if you have the patience and determination to address your imperfect skin, this product will be a great help, but it will be a very gradual process.  Some improvement, however, is easy to see quite quickly.  If your skin is at all lined, with surface creases and a general dry look, this cream will make an immediate impact that goes beyond just moisturizing.  You will also get the uplifting, mood-improving benefits of massage, even though you are doing it yourself.  The only negative I found is that the cap stopped closing after a couple of uses, so I decanted the tube contents into a jar.  It seems to me that this cream would be very helpful during weight loss, even more than afterwards, as the skin would not a have a chance to become loose in the first place.",A234YLAS2MYYWA,5.0,5.0,4.0

So this is what I have learned about the Booty Fresh..... You know how almost all toilet papers these days leave pieces behind?! Well that causes germs and bacteria to grow, which is horrible thinking about that being in my goodies! Well this Booty Fresh Intimate Odor neutralized and cleaner kills those germs and freshens tour goodies up. That is one reason I am so excited to have found this. While I know pieces get left behind, I guess I never thought about the cooties that are also left behind with them. So I have used it for this purpose and wow! It really does hel to was away the extras and leave my goodies feeling fresh and clean!

I also thought that this would be a great product for a ladies personal time. And o boy was I right. No matter what you do, ladies, for this time you know that it's just not a fresh clean feeling that can be achieved at that time. Well this helps so much! I personally don't get the stinky time blues but I do know some that do have that problem during that time of the month, and this is probably the best product for that.

Since hubby has assured me that my butt doesn't stink it's hard to say if this made a difference so I will only comment on what I do know for a fact and that is that Booty Fresh is odorless and although they need to find a different type of spray bottle that works from odd angles. it sprays on fairly easily and does leave your butt feeling softer, I assume that is from the aloe.  What concerned me about the product was that it said to not spray on genitalia, well that's easy enough but it definitely did leave me worried as to what would happen if some dripped in that direction especially considering you're supposed to spray and let it sit for 3 to 5 minutes - still scratching my head trying to figure out what position exactly would be optimal to achieve that.  I will say that I did use this under our toilet seat and it did help get rid of odors there so I guess that means it does work but let's be realistic here - Booty Fresh offers a 100% hassle free refund if it doesn't work but who wants to be that consumer who has to admit they have a really stinky but that not even a specialized product could neutralize.

Shea Nilotica 100% Pure Shea Butter 4oz (FFP),3.0,"I tried a couple of eastern Shea butter but, they never worked as advertised. This is the first east Shea butter that I tried that is actually as creamy and soft as described and it has no gritty texture to it and it actually absorbs well. I only need a small amount for it spread over my skin so I'm trying to use it sparingly, since it is expensive, but it looks smaller than four ounces. I actually had to search for it in the box since it doesn't take up much space. I do hope that bigger sizes will be available. Although, I love the creamy texture of this product, but after a week, it stopped absorbing well on my skin and it seems to be causing my skin to get more dry. I was using this product to heal my blemishes and moisturize my dry feet, but in the end, it left my skin more dry and it didn't seem to toning my skin as I hoped, due to all the rave reviews about shea butter healing the skin. The product is just too oily and it just didn't seem to absorb well on my ends ogives skin to heal my blemishes. It does feel good on the skin on a hot day, but it's only on a hot day, when I can get the butter to not leave my skin so greasy and oily. If you have thick curly hair, please don't use Shea butter in your hair, I tried using some in my hair and I'm still trying to get the product out of my hair, it seems that Shea butters acts similar to glycerin or honey, since it seals moisture in, but at the same time, it can dry out your hair by stopping any new moisture from coming in your hair or your skin, I noticed when I used Shea butter in my hair, when my hair dried, it was very soft, but when I wet my hair, it seemed to get drier and drier and more weak since the Shea butter was preventing moisture from absorbing my hair. This is the reason why I can't recommend this product for hair but if you have different type of skin, it might be a good product to use on more dry and less sensitive. It's definitely not a bad product, and is a higher quality than any Shea butter than I found in natural food stores or on Amazon but it just doesn't work for me.",A17CHDFZ6SQI9X,3.0,3.0,4.0

Rapid Detox Charcoal Exfoliant,5.0,"I received a sample of this product in a subscription box and absolutely loved it.  It's the only product that I bought the full size of.  I have been using this for about 6 months and it works amazingly well.  My skin is sensitive to fragrance and preservatives and this all natural scrub causes no irritation at all.  I use it daily and what I like best about it is that the granules dissolve very easily when I rinse my face with warm water.  I don't have to rub my skin hard, I let the crystals do the work.  I'm in my 50s but am still oily in my T zone but my cheeks occasionally get flaky.  This exfoliant is very gentle and it eliminates the flakiness while keeping my pores clear.  I have had zero blackheads since I started using this scrub every morning.  I use a foaming oil cleanser and mix in some of the crystals and give each section of my face a nice scrub.  My skin is uber sensitive but this scrub has caused no reaction.  I still use St Ives apricot scrub in the shower but it's considerably harder to wash off and the little apricot shells often get caught in my hairline.  Consequently, I've stopped using St Ives unless I'm washing my hair and can be assured that all of the scrub has been washed off.  When I don't wash my hair, I prefer to use the Clarisea crystals because they completely dissolve in water.  I like the fact that they are all natural and don't cause a problem for the environment like the beaded scrubs do (which are outlawed beginning in 2018, thank goodness).  The sea salt crystals completely disintegrate and dissolve in water.  This scrub keeps the flakiness at bay and is also great for my lips.  I use a retinol product at night and using these Clarisea crystals in the morning controls the sloughing skin nicely.  I always have a fresh smooth canvas for makeup when I use the Clarisea scrub.  I have now purchased two full size bottles and will continue to use it.  They last a long time because I only need a very small amount for each application.  They have no noticeable fragrance, which is good for me since I'm sensitive to fragranced cosmetics.  I highly recommend this scrub for all skin types.  It reveals fresh new skin every day and helps keep skin clear.  I don't use the crystals alone but rather in conjunction with a creamy cleanser so the crystals are not harsh.  But if you have troubled skin, you could very well just wet your face with warm water and use the crystals alone.  These crystals are great for clearing blackheads.  My skin looks so much better since I discovered this product.  I definitely recommend them.",A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX,5.0,5.0,4.0

UPDATE:  8/10/14
  I know this will sound crazy, but, I have a very finicky cat who doesn't like to be brushed.  Well, she has a very finicky owner who thinks she should be brushed everyday.  We were at a standoff.
When this pink brush arrived, she paid a lot of attention to it. One day while brushing my hair, she came up to be and made that cat sound that turns your head.  :-#
I didn't know what she wanted, but as a joke, I tried to brush her with my brush...this Alaska brush.  She loved it!  She let me brush her for half an hour...a true miracle.
Well, needles to say, this is now kitty's brush, and at least twice a day she comes up to it, and meows.  She actually wants to be brushed!  I tell you it's a miracle...no more cat hair anywhere!
I am sharing this story, because I am sure there are other animal people out there trying to find a great brush...look no further...and at such a low price.  Good luck!!

Alaska Bear - Hair Brush Professional Detangling Hair Comb or Brushes for Women&amp;Teen girls&amp;Mens,4.0,"My granddaughter is four, and she has long hair. You can probably guess that her hair gets tangled and knotty. It is sometimes a trial for her mother to get all the tangles out.

This brush is perfect after a shower and hair wash for anyone who has long or short hair. The bristles are soft and flexible and detangle hair with ease. The brush is a bright pink color, so it should be easy to find. It came well packaged and, enclosed in a hard plastic. Very easy to remove the plastic, and start brushing away.

For anyone with hair extensions this brush is perfect. It us also good with wigs and hair pieces. It did have a slight plastic odor outside of the box, but the odor dissipated after a bit.

"24k Gold Eye Collagen Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin B5, Vitamin E, Reduce Wrinkles and Dark Circles Around the Eye Area",5.0,"So I tried out a similar eye mask that was only for under the eyes. This one goes around the whole outer part of your eye. Let me say that these collagen eye mask work fantastic!! After 30 to 60 minutes of use. Your dark circles and puffiness are gone. Its almost like having a mini facelift!  i would use them a few times a week.

Collagen  protein is present in the connective tissue of the human body. It is produced naturally in the body and is responsible for the rejuvenation of not only the skin but also joints and nails.

The production of collagen is slowed around the age of 25. After that with each passing year the body produces less and less collagen.

Though it is not rapid but gradually the signs start showing on your face in the form of dullness, fine lines, age spots, bags and dark circles under eyes and later on sadly wrinkles.

The benefits of collagen for skin are that you will slow down all the conditions mentioned above and hence reduce the aging process.

Solution For All Your Skin Care Problems

Even if you are not using the collagen that is specifically designed to eliminate the dark circles and bags under your eyes. This will rejuvenate your skin making it radiant, youthful, and flawless.

Hyaluronic serum can offer a wide range of benefits. It is definitely effective in helping to produce healthier, younger looking skin. A low molecular weight hyaluronic serum can penetrate deep into your skin, hydrating cells, restoring collagen and elastin function, and even destroying the free radicals that form from sun, chemical, and pollutant exposure. Hyaluronic serum is actually an excellent antioxidant, and when your serum is capable of reaching the deepest layers of your skin, it can be incredibly effective at reversing damage to your cells.

SK-II Cellumination Aurabright Illuminating Essence,5.0,"My skin has taken a lot of damage in the 55 years that I've worn it.  Endless summers spent swimming and waterskiing with little more than a slathering of cocoa butter on my face has left me with LOTS of sun damage and age spots.  I have used several dark spot correctors over the years and the one made by Clinique has managed to fade them, up to a point.  I also exfoliate regularly and use a mild facial peel weekly.  Sadly, even after all that my skin still looks dull and uneven.

This Illuminating serum somehow makes my skin look brighter, as in glowing, even after just one use.  It must have some kind of reflecting particles in it to diffuse light or something, or else how can it work so fast?  I don't know, but the brightening effect gets better with consistent use.  I can tell a difference when I'm in a hurry and don't put it on because my skin looks dull and lifeless.  I'm thinking of ditching some of the other products I use on my face and just trying the SK-II line.

SK-II Cellumination Aurabright Illuminating Essence,4.0,"SK-II Cellumination is a luxurious feeling serum. My skin has been brighter, more even toned, and less dry. Since becoming a parent I have been fairly lazy with my skin care routine. I started to use just a face wipe at night instead of soap and water. Using just my basic moisturizer instead of my old nighttime routine. When I recieved the SK-II Cellumination I decided that I needed to step up my game. I pulled out my Clarisonic (which I highly recommend) to wash my face each day. I started to take time with my with my skincare routine. Applying the SK-II Cellumination before applying my moisturizer.  You use the dropper to get a a drop or two of the serum out of the bottle. The serum is a white pearly color. It is smooth, more liquid than cream, and feels luxurious. It takes two drops to cover my whole face.  Rub it between my fingers and apply over my entire face. I have rosacea and dry skin. Especially right now in the winter time. Since I started using this product a month ago by skin tone has evened out some. My roscea certainly isn't gone. My skin definitEly is brighter and less dry. I normally reapply moisturizer during the day during the winter months. I haven't had to do that since using the Cellumination. I don't know if this is a miracle product, but it has helped.

"Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, 10 Count",3.0,"I really wanted to try Crest Sensi-Stop Strips because I have really sensitive teeth. I knew I would be able to tell right away if it was working because my teeth are sensitive every day. After using the first strip, there was no relief and I was disappointed but I read in the instructions that it could use another strip the next day if you still have sensitivity. Well, I didn't want to wait until the next day and about an hour later, I went ahead and used a second strip. Now, this time I did notice a tiny bit of relief. I was surprised by that but still wished it were stronger. I think the product works but you probably will have to use more than one strip for each tooth. I don't like the fact that these are so short either. I expected them to be the length of the Crest White Strips or other strips like that. These are more like a small patch that covers about 2 teeth or maybe 3 small teeth at the most. I think these strips could definitely be stronger since 2 gave me a tiny bit of relief but with 1, I never noticed any difference. I plan to use a third strip to see if I can make the sensitivity go completely away. I do like the fact that these are supposed to last 30 days. It hasn't been a month yet so I don't know if that is true. I still think these can be good for people who don't have as sensitive teeth as mine. Just wish they made each strip stronger or longer so they covered more teeth. These can be quite expensive for just 6 little strips (patches) so I feel like I should get more for my money. Especially if I have to use 2 or 3 strips just for one tooth. Starts to not feel worth the money. Nevertheless, this product should work decent for people who do not have as much sensitivity or their sensitivity is minor. I received a free product for the purpose of my review.

I think that if you apply the strip, close your mouth and don't talk, eat, or keep touching  the strip with your tongue, you will have a better chance of it staying put. You are supposed to leave them in place for 10 minutes and you cant eat for 30 minutes. I have had a problem with sensitivity to cold as I have gotten older.

Additionally, the box does caution the user that this product has been known to NOT last the full month ... something to consider as you weigh Sensodyne against this box (of six strips).

I have cold sensitivity that reduces my enjoyment of ice cream (a personal weakness) so have been using toothpaste that has reduced my sensitivity but not eliminated it.

These are strips that are applied for 10-minutes and, as expected you need strips for each side, but the overall reduction of sensitivity is nothing short of amazing. I can now enjoy ice cream without cringing if the cold strays on one of my bad teeth.

Highly Recommended!

"Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, 10 Count",4.0,"Easy to apply with minimal prep involved (you basically affix a strip to the tooth in need of soothing and let it sit for 10 minutes) these strips are good for medium grade and below tooth sensitivity issues. As far as results go your mileage will vary but I do have one tooth in particular with mild, persistent issues whenever it comes into contact with ice. The strip does tone done the sensation by approximately 50% in my estimation so not necessarily an insta-cure but good enough to be noticeable.

Couple of things to keep in mind - each strip is very small and will cover 1 or 2 teeth each. The strips also do not 'stick' very well to the tooth so you'll need to be patient during the 10 minutes of application and try not to talk or move your mouth around. Also, I really like the convenience of having each strip individually packed making it easy to keep one in your bag/wallet while you're out and about should you ever need one.",A3M6TSEV71537G,3.7857142857142856,4.0,4.0
"Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, 10 Count",4.0,These strips work to numb pain or cold sensitivity on teeth where the gum exposes a tiny bit of the dentin at the base of the tooth. Sometimes acidic foods can irritate this area and cause sensitivity. These strips are very easy to use. You just press one of the straps against the tooth and gum that is hurting and leave it in place for 10 minutes. I was really surprised that this actually worked and continued to work for several days. I am on the seventh day now and my tooth feels just slightly sensitive again. I do eat a lot of acidic foods and drink kombucha which is kind of sour so that may contribute to the strips not lasting as long. But I still think they offer a definite benefit and start to work quickly. It Is a product that I will keep on hand from now on.,A3S3R88HA0HZG3,3.7857142857142856,4.0,4.0
"Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, 10 Count",4.0,"These consist of a wide, rather hard and sharp, plastic strip with a small stripe of gel on one side. You place one in your mouth on the gum line, outside of the tongue area, next to the aching tooth and leave in place for ten minutes. The instructions do not say to trim the plastic strip to fit, but in actual use, it was necessary to trim the strip in order to get the strip in place and have a comfortable fit for an aching  lower molar.

These worked very well, my son (30 years old, lives with me because he is disabled) had a tooth ache two weeks ago, we used one of these and his tooth hasn't bothered him since, but it was awkward to put in place, after one failed attempt of him trying to put a strip, we resorted to trimming the wide plastic strip before removing the backing and I put on a pair of disposable medical gloves and put the strip in for him.

"Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, 10 Count",4.0,"I noticed a difference the next day, after I used these.  I used it on one side of my mouth, on my lower back teeth which is the most sensitive spot in my mouth.  The next day, I put cold water in there and swished it around.  It was still sensitive, but I didn't have the screaming sensitivity that I usually have.  I think with continued use, this can dramatically minimize the sensitivity.

The strips are kind of hard to get off the sheet.  I wasn't sure if I was doing it right, and there weren't any instructions.  You have a big sheet of plastic with a little piece of the sensitivity strip in the middle.  You have to peel that part off, but it doesn't come off easily.  It is a little tricky to do.  I didn't notice a taste.  You aren't supposed to eat or drink for 30 minutes after you use them and you only leave them on for 10 minutes.

I am going to try these a week before my next dental cleaning, in January.  If I notice a difference, I will come back and change my review to 5 stars, and you will all be hearing about it!  For now, I recommend giving these a try.",A3OC93X866Z8TB,3.7857142857142856,4.0,4.0
"Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, 10 Count",4.0,"A few years ago I was head butted by a pit bull while volunteering at an animal shelter. No damage according to my dentist but I do suffer from occasional sensitivity in the area where I was hit. I've used specialized toothpaste but the transient nature of the sensitivity makes it hard to justify.  These tabs do seem to provide relief. They are small and adhere without issue. Leave them on for ten minutes and abstain from eating or drinking for another half hour. The effect is supposed to last for up to a month.

So far these have provided relief and  are as effective as the toothpastes. They don't cover a large area and it takes some dexterity to get them in harder to reach places. I would check with a dentist first to make sure the problem tooth isn't crack or cavity.

"Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, 10 Count",3.0,"I wore braces for several years as an adult and one of the most alarming things was my new sensitivity to cold. (I managed to get over the sensitivity to jalapenos.)  I used to love ice cream.  I used to chomp on ice chips.  But when my braces were on, I had to microwave ice cream - even though I have previously made fun of people for doing that.  Sometimes Karma just turns around and bites.

I was looking forward to the braces coming off for a lot of reasons but at least one of them was to chomp on a popsicle.  OOPS.  NOPE.

"Seaweed Powder for Cellulite, Facials, Body Wraps",5.0,"I am very skeptical when it comes to any product that says it reduces cellulite or gets rid of cellulite, because there is no instant fix for dimple thighs (except for maybe liposuction or laser treatments but my budget doesn't allow for that).  I have tried many lotions, creams, massagers and nothing has ever seems to make a difference that I can see and feel.  I say feel, in reference to how smooth my skin feels on the back of my thighs compared to the front of my thighs after using this powder mixed into a scrub I've been using on the back & sides of my thighs & butt.

Before I started using this seaweed powder in a scrub I did exfoliate my legs/thighs & butt regularly.  No joke, I used the green side of a Scotch-Brite kitchen sponge to exfoliate the skin on my legs.  This is how I know this is not just because I all of a sudden started paying more attention to my thighs and exfoliating them with a scrub (seaweed or not) that my skin feels like this.  I have other body scrubs I use regularly but since I have quit using those on my thighs and just started using the seaweed scrub on my thighs, my skin feel much more even and soft.

The recipe on the side of the jar says: 3 tbsp Seaweed Powder, 1/4 cup sea salt, 1/4 cup olive oil, drop of essential oil.
I sort of tweaked the recipe on the side of the jar and added a few extra things.. I used
4 tbsp Seaweed Powder
1/4 cup sea salt
1/4 cup sugar
1 tbsp olive oil
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar (optional)
1/2 cup coconut oil (fractionated (liquid) works best but you can melt solid coconut oil and it will work fine too) - I started with a 1/4 cup and added about a 1/4 cup more because I like my scrubs a little more liquidy
& last but not least, Peppermint essential oil - A LOT, like I think I used a tablespoon or more trying to cover up the smell of the apple cider vinegar (which I may leave out next time).

I also tried sort of like a face mask on my butt & thighs, equal parts seaweed powder and sodium bentonite clay (""Indian Healing Clay"") and water until smooth and put this on my face and then added peppermint oil and put the rest on my thighs for about 15-20 min.  I really think its the combination of the seaweed powder with the peppermint oil that has made my skin/thighs look and feel so much better.  After looking at the concoction I made I realized the amount of seaweed powder is less of an overall percentage of the final product than what the bottle recipe is.  So I'll definitely try what the bottle says next time.

I am so very pleased with this product.  I am very grateful I was given this product to review because I don't think I would have thought an ocean weed could do anything for my skin, my thighs, or cellulite because I've tried so many products claiming to help cellulite.  That being said, this seaweed powder is amazing, and I will definitely be purchasing more when it runs out because I like the results I see.

"Glycolic Acid 30% At Home Chemical Peel for Your Best Microdermabrasion. This Anti-Aging Exfoliation Treatment Attacks Acne and Scarring, Diminishes Age Spots and Reduces Fine Lines",5.0,"*Free product provided for evaluation and review.*

I was new to face peels.  This came with a e-book that described the process.  I got some baking soda, and a new artist's paintbrush and cottonballs, as recommended, to do my first peel.  It was easy.  The instructions had said for the first time to be only 2 minutes.  I used a kitchen timer and using the eyedropper and the brush, applied the 30% glycolic acid solution and left it on for 2 minutes.  It tingled a bit but that was all.

My face didn't look much different afterwards.  It was easy to get off.  My face felt a bit dry, so I followed up with hyaluronic acid serum.  I never did note any peeling, and I didn't have any redness, but in the days to follow I did notice that my skin seemed a bit brighter.  The next time I left it on for 5 minutes, because my face is pretty tough.  This time I felt a bit more tingling and I did have a bit of flaking.  My skin looks much brighter over all, and it seemed like it lightened my faded freckles up even more.

I like the product and will continue to use it until I find that sweet spot of time that's just right for me.  I can see where this treatment does help skin to look younger and more clear.  I haven't had any real progress with fine lines, but I can tell the potential is there and will happen with time and more treatments.  There's enough in the bottle for MANY treatments.  It only takes a bit.

 I recommend it, along with a good hyaluronic serum to follow the treatments.",A2R1HUYHXV7H18,5.0,5.0,4.0
"Glycolic Acid 30% At Home Chemical Peel for Your Best Microdermabrasion. This Anti-Aging Exfoliation Treatment Attacks Acne and Scarring, Diminishes Age Spots and Reduces Fine Lines",5.0,"This 30% glycolic acid peel is gentle, and left my skin smooth and glowing.  I'm no stranger to peels; I know what my skin can handle, and I left it on for fifteen minutes. If you're new to these at home peels, I'd recommend starting with five minutes to see how your skin reacts.  This peel is mild enough to use a couple of times a week, and it's everything the manufacturer says it is.

There's no fragrance, and the solution comes in a dark blue dropper top bottle.  You only need a dropper full for a thin coat on face and neck.  After applying, there's a little tingle.  It's not unpleasant; it just lets you know the product is working.  The results are immediate.

It's safe to plan to use this the same day you want to look your best for an important event; it doesn't leave your skin red or raw, just refreshed.  I'd recommend using a hyurolonic oil or heavy-duty moisturizer afterwards.  Good stuff!

"Mens Face Moisturizer 3.38 fl.oz - After Shave Balm for Men - Soothing Day &amp; Night Moisturizing Facial Cream - Suitable For Dry Or Sensitive Skin - Anti Aging SPF Lotion - Mens Gift Set, Travel Size",5.0,"This luxury face moisturizer for men is a no-nonsense, powerful facial hydrator and soothing after-shave lotion all in one.  It comes in a small (3.38 oz), slick, cool, professional metallic case (see photos), so it's small enough to fit nicely in any bathroom or travel bag.  The formula keeps your skin hydrated while fueling your face with amazing stuff daily.  Not only does it nourish, it also absorbs quickly and completely for a masculine matte finish without greasiness.  This moisturizer is free from phthalates, sulfates, synthetic dyes, parabens.  It's 100% vegan and cruelty free with no animal testing.  Their ingredients work to moisturize, heal, protect and visibly improve your skin's appearance all year round.  The key ingredients include: Aloe Vera which has strong healing and anti-inflammatory properties that soothe shaving and irritation and Argan oil which is used to hydrate and soften skin.  These are ideal ingredients to give skin a natural boost.  It's a popular choice for business executives and professionals.  It comes in a lockable dispenser with cap to protect it from messy spillage, which comes in handy while you're traveling.

Although there's something to be said for that weathered look that adds character, there's also something about a clean shaven man who prides himself in the smooth look no many strive to achieve.  The fact is, everyone ages - mean and women alike.  Our face loses elasticity as we get older.  This doesn't have to happen in your 30s.  Not to mention, natural 'weathering' can lead to nasty skin conditions and worst case scenario - skin cancer.  The only way to avoid this and look younger at the same time is to treat your skin well and this includes a regular (1-2 x daily) application of a good moisturizer.  Don't think of it as 'makeup'.  It's just a way to lock in moisture and protect from the elements.  The best part is it takes very little time and very little product to get the polished look you had in your 20s.

All it takes is a quick regimen that starts after you put your razor down in the morning.  After you shave, wash your whole face, pat it (don't rub it because this pulls at your skin) and grab this moisturizer and gently apply it from the forehead down.  Since it doubles as an after-shave lotion, it will soothe the burn that occurs after you shave.  I recommend applying it to slightly damp skin (so there's moisture to lock in), dot moisturizer around the key problem areas (forehead, cheekbones, jawline and neck) then gently massage it into your skin using circular motions.  Be extra gentle around your eye area - I recommend using your ring finger to gently pat it into the skin around your eyes.  That's all you need to do.  Simple and quick way to hold on to the skin appearance you absolutely love.

Remember, when it comes to getting your skin back to a younger look, there's very little you can do after the fact, so prevention is your best weapon.  Your skin, like your body, benefits from a positive lifestyle.  First and foremost, get enough rest, drink plenty of water, avoid prolonged sun exposure (ear a hat if you work outdoors), eat healthy food and take 1-2 minutes a day to add a moisturizer to combat the effects of daily living.  After all, you don't want to resort to Botox or face-lifts because they're unnecessary if you take preventative precautions from the beginning.

My son is only 16 years old, but like me, he has extremely sensitive skin.  Although I spend the money on face wash specially designed for men for him to use, he still has issues with dry flaky skin.  We have tried several men's moisturizers in the past, yet none of them worked to really clear up his skin.  When I was given the opportunity to review this product, I was hoping it would give him the result we've been looking for in other products.  I'm happy to say it has.  He's been using this product everyday for the last couple of weeks and we saw visible improvement after day two.  He no longer has the dry flaky skin he's been plagues with,m especially around his eyes.  Not to mention he's experienced no redness or irritation from the ingredients.  I recommend it for all skin types because it comes with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.  Either it works or you get your money back.

As you can see from the product image, this comes with two products -- a lip stain and a balm -- in one container.  I have found that I only needed to apply the lip stain (or liquid lipstick, or whatever you want to call it) once and it lasted throughout an entire work day.  So they're not lying about the 16 hours (well, I probably wore it for more like 10 or 11 hours, but it still looked good and was a bit difficult to remove at the end of that time).  I applied it using the doefoot applicator it comes with and then kept my lips slightly open while I let it dry.

I gave it a few minutes and did other things to get ready, then applied the balm over it.  The balm has a similar applicator to the lip stain part.  The balm (or you might call it a gloss) is clear.  It did pick up some of the color of the stain on the applicator when I used it, but no big deal since I'm only going to ever use the balm *with* the stain.  Anyway, although the stain itself was rather drying, using the second step made this product completely comfortable to wear.  I did have to reapply the balm a few times throughout the day.

I did not get much color transfer to mugs and I did not lose much color over the course of the day.  I found the appearance of the product quite acceptable at the end of the day.  It was actually a bit difficult to get off; I used a dual phase liquid makeup remover on a cotton pad and I kind of had to scrub.  You may want to finish up with a lip scrub to ensure complete removal.  Anyway, this stuff has staying power.

The berry color I had was more of a cool red than a true berry color, at least on my lips.  I really liked the color.  I'm pale, but I think it would show up on people with darker skin tones as well.  This was non-irritating and didn't have a noticeable fragrance.

Overall, I'm very happy with this product.  Definitely glad I bought it.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,4.75,5.0,4.0
"Rimmel Provocalips 16hr Kissproof Lipstick, Kiss Fatal, 0.14 Fluid Ounce",5.0,"ive tried these types of lipsticks before with little luck. Usually they feel really dry, you end up using all the top coat gloss right away and it still felt gross and peeled off. This is not the case! First of all, before applying make absolutely sure your lips are freshly clean and dry, no other makeup of moisturizer. After applying a very thin coat, let it dry completely before using the top coat. Do this and it will last 12 hours! It only faded a tiny bit after I ate greasy pizza and I only applied the top coat one time. It never felt after the initial application of top coat, in fact it felt like it had worn off completely until I looked in the mirror and was pleasantly surprised to see it hadn't budged! And the best part is that is doesn't feel like there is anything on my lips! Definitely worth the price! This will be a repurchase for sure!",A9WF2OPZZKBI4,4.75,5.0,4.0

"Lactic Acid 30% At Home Chemical Peel for Your Best Microdermabrasion. This Anti-Aging Chemical Peel Exfoliation Treatment Reduces the Signs of Scarring, Diminishes Age Spots and Erases Fine Lines",5.0,"I am astonished.  Really.  Truly.  I have somewhat dry skin with alot of sensitivity: it often feels as if it's sunburned.  When it's not. So I was hesitant to try a chemical peel, but wanted to because I have some major discoloration.  Mostly from sun damage, mostly on my cheekbones and cheeks.  Just little tan spots here and there. I also have a bit of small scars from old acne, almost as if they healed with a change in pigmentation.

SO, I tried this out, using the Ebook from the Carbon company for advice on how to do it.  I was sort of chicken so started with two minutes only, and I exfoliated with ExfoliKate by Kate Sommerville first.  Put it on, no sting, rinsed it off after two minutes.  Used a baking soda solution to neutralize the acid (will try and find the ebook link so you can see their recipe).  Rinsed more and more and then used the Serum designed to work with it (I will review it separately, it's called Hyaluronic Acid, also by Carbon).  I was expecting to feel sunburned the next day but didn't.

Here's the thing, it worked amazing the first time.  I noticed one side of my space especially looked clearer and more even (maybe I sat in the sun and one side is worse??).  I couldn't believe it.  I waited one week and did it again.  Still, an improvement. I really can't even explain.  It's just evener and the brown spots are almost gone.  I'm sticking to the two minute regimen for now, I'm still too chicken to go for longer.  I'm going to keep doing it weekly for now.

I did get a bit crazy and used it on my cleavage (decollete?) because I have many many discoloring sun spots.  Didn't notice as much improvement there, possibly because the discoloration is pretty bad.  Will keep trying.

The wildest thing was this, however: I did the back of my hands and the top of my feet as well.  (You only need a tiny bit).  My hands are quite beat up and discolored with various scars etc, and the top of my feet looked sort of awful because of a summer of flip-flops and weird tan lines and always dinging my feet on something or other.  There was hugely noticeable improvements in both of these areas.  Each time I followed the same regimen.

On my feet, I also used (the next day) a whitening cream from another manufacturer, and left it on all day. It really made my feet look pretty and softer and between it and the chemical peel, looks great for winter.

Very very pleased.

I rec'd sample from manufacturer for review.",A2LAS014NSRW72,5.0,5.0,4.0
"Lactic Acid 30% At Home Chemical Peel for Your Best Microdermabrasion. This Anti-Aging Chemical Peel Exfoliation Treatment Reduces the Signs of Scarring, Diminishes Age Spots and Erases Fine Lines",5.0,"I am new to lactic acid treatments, but after having a baby, my skin care regimen seemed to need some help. I developed a couple of age spots on my forehead, some areas of redness and whiteheads around my nose, and some fine lines that were definitely new. While I don't mind some natural signs of aging, I don't see why I need to look any older than I have to, so when I was offered a sample of this lactic acid peel to test, I was really excited to try it out. I read in a book on dermatology that this is one of the first, simplest steps people can take to reveal a fresh new layer of skin, and the manufacturer told me that this is the percentage of lactic acid they recommend for beginners.

The manufacturers warn that it can take many peels, even six or seven peels, before you see noticeable results. I have to say that I saw the results much sooner. After about the third peel, I noticed that the area of whiteheads around my nose had reduced significantly. I also noticed that the odd, oily or bumpy texture on my forehead went away entirely. While it did not get rid of my age spots or fine lines, the difference is already dramatic and that I feel like myself again, only a little bit fresher and more revitalized. And, you never know, I am only on peel number six, so I may continue to see increased benefits over time.

Overall, I was really delighted with the results. Though it is always an investment of time and money to try a new technique like this, purchasing an at home peel is a much cheaper first step in visiting the dermatologist, as I can tell you from personal experience. I really feel an enormous boost my self-esteem to have my skin look so much more fresh.",A2MBLVMVDLHK1L,5.0,5.0,4.0

Pantene Pro-V Volume Conditioner 12.0 Fluid Ounce (Product Size May Vary),5.0,"I like the Pantene Color protect shampoo, but the conditioner that goes with it is not a great match with my hair. Tends to leave me looking flat and a feeling a little dry, so I use a couple of other brands in rotation. This Pantene Volume version may very well be the answer. It smells great, just light and sort of spring fresh to me, not a heavy perfume. It rinsed out clean, but my very thick hair was still tangle free while wet. Once dry, my hair looks great! I have thick, lush hair that reaches the middle of my back in a blunt cut - no layers here. The wrong conditioner can make my hair look like a curtain. Nobody wants that.

Pantene Pro-V Volume Conditioner 12.0 Fluid Ounce (Product Size May Vary),4.0,"Since a conditioner affects your hair differently based on its unique qualities, I will first state that my hair is very long, thick, wavy, soft, and aging (I'm 50). It is not color treated. I have some flyaway hair and split ends, but nothing too overwhelming. My main concerns are shine enhancement/retention, ease of combing out, and body retention. My hair can take some pretty heavy conditioning without flattening out.

This conditioner left my hair very soft and made it easy to comb through my wet hair after shampooing and conditioning. It's creamy and thick so you don't need a large amount for coverage, even with relatively voluminous hair. While this didn't do too much to enhance shine, it didn't dull what I already had. I found that it smoothed hair a little less (some ""frizzy"" parts) than some conditioners in the lower portions (despite my attention to even distribution) and did a better job smoothing the top. It did not suppress the natural waves my hair has or weigh it down.

All in all, I think this is a pretty good conditioner, but it may work better for someone with younger hair who doesn't need so much in the way of shine enhancement.",A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,4.444444444444445,4.0,4.0
Pantene Pro-V Volume Conditioner 12.0 Fluid Ounce (Product Size May Vary),4.0,"Overall a decent, daily conditioner from Pantene.

The end result is a well performing weightless conditioner that does add tangible volume and lift and becomes even more pronounced if blow drying is performed immediately after.

A small dab is all that is needed to adequately work through the hair. The product easily rinses out and does leave a nice, silky finish that holds up for hours on untreated hair.  There is a pronounced sweet berry fragrance that may or may not be too your liking but all told, its fairly pleasant and unobtrusive.",A3M6TSEV71537G,4.444444444444445,4.0,4.0

The thing I like best about this conditioner is that it leaves my hair tangle-free after conditioning.

Suzanne Somers 3 Way Poncho AS SEEN ON TV Can be worn three ways,5.0,Some of these reviews make me laugh. It is what it is ... a $20 top from an infomercial ... what did you expect? A Donna Karan original? The fabric is thin (the black is see through in fact) but it's super comfy. It's meant to fit big and the arms are supposed to be tight ... it's almost a bat wing type of sleeve. I can't see wearing the hood - it's really not big enough. I wouldn't wear it off the shoulders - doesn't look good. Looks best over tight jeans with big earrings.

Suzanne Somers 3 Way Poncho AS SEEN ON TV Can be worn three ways,4.0,"&nbsp;The name of this garment may set wrong expectations. A poncho is a single large sheet of fabric with an opening in the center, it may have a hood, it can be made out of different materials, but it does not have sleeves. This garment does. So it is not a poncho.

I would describe it as a loose fitting blouse with a large cowl neck. The neckline that is flowy and either drapes down or can be stretch over one or two shoulders. The blouse is made out of thin material, so it drapes well. Its loose fit is flattering as it does not cling to reveal fat rolls or any other body imperfections.

The material is thin, but I have worn it to work this week (we are having a cold December) by layering a sweater under it. I got the XL-3X size, but it is not too big as drapes well. The material is 95% Viscose and 5% Spandex. It is quite thin, but this what makes it drape well. The yoke is made out of double fabric, so it has a little more structure than the top itself. The sleeves are 3/4 length, they fit me comfortably. I wear it with the draped neckline it over pant/jeans. I got the one in black color so I spice it up with colorful scarves and layer with sweaters. This blouse is not a high end couture. It is a casual outfit. It does not look out of place at my work place.

Manufacturers instructions recommend to wash in cold water with similar colors. I washed the blouse by hand to see if it is colorfast, and discovered that it is colorfast and does not bleed, but it sheds black fibers. I washed 5 times and continued to shed fibers. This fibers are not individual threads, they look like fuzz. I am including a photo of what was left in my sink as the water draned. The fabric does not shed when it was dry, and when I took it off there was no shedding on my sweater.

So what's the bottom line? Not bad for a casual looking blouse, but overpriced due to the celebrity endorsement.

This poncho is provided by 3 Way Poncho.

Nerd Skincare Miraculous Brightening Facial Mask,4.0,"I saw an advertisement on Facebook to get sample of this mask for $1 so I thought I'd try it.  I love good face masks and buy singles all the time, hoping to one day find one that's perfect.  This one does deliver on it's promise to brighten my skin and tighten pores- I could tell a noticeable difference in my face when I took it off- my face seemed lighter in color, and brighter, and my pores were about as tight as they ever get.  I didn't really find that it reduced fine lines though - so far only the 'at home chemical peels' that I use really deliver strongly on that promise, though some various serums and creams do help.

It comes in a net, and it's loaded with a white cream.  The mask itself feels like alginate material, and has precut eyes, nose, and lips.  The nose was too long for me, so the upper lip portion just was all out of whack.  It took a while for me to adjust it so I could breath and so that I had adequate facial covering.  It's to be worn 30 minutes optimally.  It is very hydrating, and it rinses easily when time is up.

I am always hesitant when it comes to hair appliances that are by unknown brands.  I always tend to use well known brands such as FHI, CHI, Sudo, etc.  However  the ease of use, functions and overall performance of the Ivation Professional Flat Iron has out performed and exceeded my expectations over my $200+ flat irons.

The touch sensitive controls are located inside the handles so no more accidentally turning the temperature down or annoying beeps because most digital displays have the controls outside where your fingers are constantly touching them.  To control the temperature and power, just lightly place your finger over the power icon or slide it up or down to control the temperature on the touch control panel.

It is truly amazing how quickly it heats up to your desired temperature.  You can watch the blue LED screen rapidly count up from 76 to 450 degrees in less than one minute.  This flat iron will glide over your hair like silk. It will leave you hair silky smooth and full of shine. Tourmaline ceramic plates produces far infra-red heat to release negative ions which reduces static and helps seal the cuticle to make your hair smoother and shiner. Tourmaline flat irons are highly recommended if you have really curly or frizzy hair.  Of course, even though using tourmaline ceramic plates can protect hair from high heat damage and breakage, you should always use a heat protection spray or product in your hair before flat ironing.

Comes with a VERY long 9 foot swivel cord.  It is extremely lightweight.

Automatically turns off if left unattended for 30 minutes.

Comes with a one-year warranty.

My daughter has used this for awhile now (she's only 10) and has had no trouble. When I've used it on her, it was easy to hold and worked fast. A sample was provided for review.",A1EVV74UQYVKRY,5.0,5.0,4.0
"Ivation Professional Flat Iron Hair Straightener w/Premium Floating, Tourmaline-Ceramic Plates &ndash; Super-Fast Heating up to 450&deg;F Degrees in Just 60 Seconds, Perfect for Brazilian Keratin Treatments &ndash; Crystal-Clear Temperature Display &amp; Touch-Sensitive Controls &ndash; The Ultimate Flat Iron, Hair Curler, Hair Straightener/Styler for Effortlessly Gorgeous Hairstyles",5.0,"With two daughters, we've owned our share of curling and flat irons, almost all bought from Walmart or some other discount type store.  They did a decent job but usually died in a year or so - and one memorable Conair straightener caught on fire (luckily without anyone's hair in it!).  When I had an opportunity to try this Ivation professional-grade flat iron I wondered how it would differ from the ""civilian"" ones.

I'm happy to report that this flat iron really is better!  The ceramic plates slide effortlessly through my daughters' hair, without leaving a tortured, ironed look to it.  They had shiny, bouncy hair without any crimp marks or damage, and they could even make flips and curls by using this iron.  The actual plates are attached with a pivot, so they ""give"" a little as you use them.  I'm not up to speed on what infra-red and negative ionic energy does for hair, but my daughters assured me it takes away frizzies and adds the shine I mentioned above.

The iron heated up extra quickly, and we were all impressed by the digital-slider adjustment for the temperature.  The 9 foot cord with a swivel puts an end to tangled cords and standing near an outlet, and the auto-shutoff will never leave you wondering if you left something turned on at home.

I expected this to cost at least $60, but the price is not much more than a Conair or other brand we've tried.  Overall this is a very well made and useful flat iron, and I might even be tempted to let the girls tackle my curls and give it a try.

I received a black Ivation Professional Flat Iron (it comes in several colors) for testing and review purposes.  I wasn't asked or expected to leave a positive review, and this is my honest opinion of the product.",AEC90GPFKLAAW,5.0,5.0,4.0
Yalmeh Naturals Eye Bright Gel,5.0,"I have tried other Yalmeh products in the past and have been very happy with the results that I got. Needless to say, I had high hopes when I started using this eye gel. I was and still am very impressed with how well it works for my sensitive undereye area, as it really reduces the puffiness under my eyes that I am perpetually plagued with, when I wake up in the morning. It is also working so well as far as hydrating my eye area goes! This product and brand always delivers the results that I am hoping to get from skin care products. Love this brand and product!

I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. Im just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.

Yalmeh Naturals Eye Bright Gel,5.0,"I have to give a big shout out to Yalmeh for sending me this Glory Eye Bright Gel to review.  It has become my favorite day time eye cream of the moment.  It just feels so refreshing when you put it on, especially early in the morning when your still feeling tired and your eyes are still in the process of waking up.  The Glory Eye Bright Gel is really hydrating and really light weight so it just melts into the skin around your eyes.  It also really helps with all that puffiness that I always have under my eyes in the morning.  I naturally have dark circles around my eyes so I don't really benefit from the eye brightening capabilities of this eye cream but I can see how it would work great for those people that have dark circles from things like not getting enough sleep.  All that and it has also made the fine lines around my eyes less noticeable!!",A11WQTPV352LGH,5.0,5.0,4.0
BMC Matte Finish UV/LED Nail Lacquer Gel Polish Top Coat,5.0,"Love this matte to coat!! Definitely gives a good matte finish.

The Anti Aging Retinol Serum is the latest product I am trying and have incorporated it into my nightly regimen. I wash my face, use toner and then use the Serum. All of the facial products are easy to use, you don't need a lot and they absorb easily. There is just a barely there scent, not perfumy, but not chemically either. My skin gets a bit dry here in Northern Wisconsin so having something that works on my skin is great. Plus my face is 63 years old so I really need a product that not only helps with the dryness but the wrinkles too. I really don't have any wrinkles on my face so I am lucky there, I want to keep them at bay for as long as possible!
I like this product! Oh yes, you only need one tiny pump so this serum will last a long time!

I feel that my skin is looking very good! I have a new stress breakout on my chin :( Even though I haven't had any for a while. Anyway! Other than that, my skin has been looking so fresh and smooth and this product is one I have been consistently using for the past several weeks, daily. I really like it!

OZNaturals Anti Aging Retinol Serum -The Most Effective Anti Wrinkle Serum Contains Professional Strength Retinol+ Astaxanthin+ Vitamin E - Get The Dramatic Youthful Results You&rsquo;ve Been Looking For,5.0,"I started using retinol products (other than this one) about a year ago after reading so many reports about the benefits of Vitamin A (in the form of retinol) for aging skin (or skin in general).  It certainly made a difference to my face and has kept my skin youthful.

Overall I really like this retinol serum for a few reasons.  I have used retinol creams before and I don't always want a cream.  I like that this is a serum - so I like that can get the benefits of retinol without having to put on a heavy cream.  Also it's lightweight and dries quickly, making it easy to use.

I love that this is in a airless pump bottle (which I will definitely be refilling when it's empty) because it keeps the lotion bacteria free.  I think that small, often overlooked, aspect of this type of packaging truly helps my skin stay clear.  Using face lotions in airless pumps prevents growth of bacteria inside your face products and thus minimizes the amount of bacteria that goes on your skin when you apply them.  This is why I like to transfer my serums into airless pump bottles as well as my liquid foundations etc.

Some words of advice when purchasing retinol creams/serums.  Make sure it actually contains RETINOL.  Some retinol creams/serums that say ""retinol"" on the front of the bottle actually contain a derivative of vitamin A that is less effective (for your skin) and cheaper (for the manufacturer), which is retinyl palmitate.  Make sure if a bottle says it's retinol, that the ingredient list says retinol, like this product.

OZNaturals Anti Aging Retinol Serum -The Most Effective Anti Wrinkle Serum Contains Professional Strength Retinol+ Astaxanthin+ Vitamin E - Get The Dramatic Youthful Results You&rsquo;ve Been Looking For,5.0,"I have reviewed several products from Oz Naturals now and find their products to be very good. This Retinol Serum is an intense wrinkle correcting cream that will give you dramatic results. Great for even sensitive skin. Astaxanthin has been shown to help improve skin moisture levels, elasticity, and smoothness while reducing wrinkles, freckles, and spots.

I have been using it nightly and I think I need a longer time to use it, so I will continue my nightly regimen to include Oz Naturals 2.5% Retinol Serum with Astaxanthin as it takes a lifetime to achieve wrinkles and other skin imperfections it will most likely take time to see dramatic results. This serum goes on nice, put it on areas you need or all over your face. It absorbs quickly and is non-greasy.

All my life I've been a sun worshipper and after trying so many different products with little to no results I feared that the damage was done but after recently being introduced to Oz Naturals and being so pleased with the results of their other products I figured I'd give this a shot and boy am I glad I did.  I can't believe the how the subtle differences have grown and with the results I've seen thus far I'm hoping that over time it will reduce and reverse the effects of sun damage. This 2.5% Retinol Cream speeds up cell turnover and boosts collagen and elastin, leaving my skin smoother while repairing the damage years of neglect has done . I apply a pea size amount of the serum each morning and evening and the results have been obvious to anyone who knows me.  doesn't test on animals and this product is paraben free, only pure ingredients.

OZNaturals Anti Aging Retinol Serum -The Most Effective Anti Wrinkle Serum Contains Professional Strength Retinol+ Astaxanthin+ Vitamin E - Get The Dramatic Youthful Results You&rsquo;ve Been Looking For,5.0,"The market is filled with ant-aging products and even though we have many too choose from, some rarely work. Like I have mentioned in past reviews, no oversight like in the supplement world, so most products just have to not hurt you and they are really overlooked and still being sold. I spent the last few weeks testing out serums to devices that help with aging skin. It's so hard knowing I invested a few weeks and a product just did not deliver what was stated.

Thankfully, Oz Naturals was not one of them!

I love retinol and especially one that did not cost an office visit. Yes, the prescriptions are not as costly as one would think but the office visits cost money and refills require another office visit. It gets up there and I honestly do not feel I am need of the prescription strength, yet. I prefer to not over medicate my face because if I up the potency, I also up the side effects and with Summer around, I also up my chances of getting a red and peely face. I'm all for anti-aging but shedding skin like a lizard is not sexy no matter the bikini you wear!

Oz Naturals has a 2.5% retinol serum, which contains Astaxanthin and Vitamin E. The formula is a strong orange hue in color that always makes me think the retinol oxidized, as yellow is the first tinge you see when it does, followed by the orange color that comes after. Thankfully, this is just a coloring from the ingredients versus a serum going wonky and I prefer getting pass the color versus a dye being added to just calm my fears. That is what Oz Naturals does, it offers a natural approach to your skincare's needs.

Ingredients (as listed on website): Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), HamamelisVirginiana (Witch Hazel), Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic SimmondsiaChinensis (Jojoba Oil), TriticumVulgare (Wheat Germ Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), WildcraftedResinaPropoli (Propolis), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.

Astaxanthin: This was an ingredient that I had heard of but was not familiar with, as not any of my beauty products contain it. It's a carotenoid and an antioxidant. It's what they feed salmon when people for some reason want to see a pinker/orange hue in their fish. It does not convert to retionol (Vitamin A), however research which is still limited, has reflected it may aid with inflammation, oxidation and even UV damage. I like that it's simple and as long as it's derived naturally and not in it's synthetic form, it has the potential to help and protect against oxidative (free-radical) aging skin.

Verdict:
I love serums because my skin loves them. They absorb quickly and that means less residue and you don't feel that heaviness that some creams tend to leave behind. Most serums play well with cosmetics and because I have increased my retinol use to both day and night use, just making sure I use sunscreen in the day to avoid redness or hyper-pigmentation issues. The latter part would kind of go against what I am trying to do (save my skin), so please don't skip on your SPF. I used the serum for a total of 3 weeks and like always, I am going from one 2.5% retinol brand to another. I will notice if a product works if it does or does not maintain the progress I have previously achieved, and I can then measure if the new serum brings anything new to the party. Even though Oz Naturals is orange in color, it did not leave a orange colored goop that was hard to hide. My skin absorbed the serum with no problems! I did notice that my skin at week two had a nicer and more pleasant texture. My skin had a glow that the previous retinol serum did not add. It was not an oily glow but just a healthy one and because I suffer from horrible seasonal allergies, this is something that unfortunately always reflects on my face and sadly my skin. The glow I got sort of helped make me look healthier and less tired, so it took attention away from the signs of having bad allergies gives you. I'll take it! Any serum that can do more than just deliver retinol is what I seek. I'm always looking to simplify my routine and I literally went from Oz Naturals 2.5% retinol serum to then moisturizer at night, and done! Just switch to an SPF moisturizer in the day and it's the easiest and most effective duo I have found, so no excuses that you have no time for your skin. With Oz Naturals, you will only need 3 minutes to get what I consider a good anti-aging beauty regimen, so you can even do it while brushing your teeth :)

OZNaturals Anti Aging Retinol Serum -The Most Effective Anti Wrinkle Serum Contains Professional Strength Retinol+ Astaxanthin+ Vitamin E - Get The Dramatic Youthful Results You&rsquo;ve Been Looking For,5.0,"I have really been crazy out the OZ products and I have been happy to get rid of any vestiges of other products.  Out with the Clinique, even out with the blue bottles, it must all go.  Now here is another product that is better than any of the Clinique products I depended on and at a fraction of the cost.

This is a retinol serum.  I use it on my clean skin before I put moisturizer on in the morning and at night.  .  I think that it multiplies the effect of a moisturizer by making it easier to absorb.  After six weeks of using this, my skin has a better texture and feels softer.  I don't see the finer lines on my skin.

I have always been careful to use quality products on my face for the past thirty years and this is one of the best lines of products.  These are products that are the same quality, but at a much lower price.  It's just amazing.

Works very gently but decisively in skimming off dead cells to reveal new, healthy skin. It absorbs quickly and isn't greasy. I added it to my nighttime regimen and within a week, my complexion was experiencing a really radiant, healthy glow, and all without redness or irritation.

I'd also add that OZ products are, by and large, an excellent buy. This container was enormous and should easily last six months. I can't recommend this skin care line highly enough.

OZNaturals Anti Aging Retinol Serum -The Most Effective Anti Wrinkle Serum Contains Professional Strength Retinol+ Astaxanthin+ Vitamin E - Get The Dramatic Youthful Results You&rsquo;ve Been Looking For,5.0,"I have been seriously impressed with all of the serums and moisturizers from this line, but I have to say the retinal serum and the retinal moisturizer that goes with it have given me the strongest results. As a 36-year-old mother of a toddler, I've definitely seen some additional fine lines cropping up in the last year. My skin also just seems to feel a little more dull. I've only been using this serum for a week, but I have already noticed a dramatic difference in the fine lines around my mouth and at the corners of my eyes.

I have been using the retinol moisturizer from this line for about six weeks though, and I think that is part of why I am seeing faster results by adding the serum into the combination. What I do is cleanse, use a toner to open my pores and get me ready for a serum, apply the serum, brush my hair while I wait for it to dry, and then add moisturizer. I repeat the process in the morning and evening, using a night cream and an eye cream at bedtime, and I can tell I am seeing great results because I actually forgot and stopped doing anything besides cleansing and moisturizing for about a week and half around the holidays, and I looked much more tired. As soon as I picked up my routine again, and added this retinal serum for additional boost, the results came back and then some.

I will caution that I have read that ladies who are pregnant or trying to become so should not use retinal treatments during that particular time because the vitamin A does sink into your skin and is absorbed into your system, and the book I read about fertility and becoming pregnant said that because you don't know how much of the vitamin A has sunk into your skin, it's hard to regulate the exact quantity of this nutrient, and during a delicate time such as pregnancy, you need to be a little bit more regimented. However, I began using the retinol moisturizer after I finished nursing, and since pregnancy and nursing does really take a lot of nutrients from you and I was seeing the negative result of that on my skin, I would highly recommend the product for getting back to yourself after pregnancy, childbirth and nursing.",A2MBLVMVDLHK1L,4.866666666666666,5.0,4.0

I have been trying this now for about a week or so.
The first thing I noticed about this is that it is packaged nice enough that I would be happy to give it as a gift.  I washed my face as normal and then applied this serum.  I have been using this at night and after I apply the serum, I use my regular face  Moisturizer after I am all done applying it.  It doesn't have an oily feel to it, and has a pleasant smell to it.  I have noticed a big difference in my skin already.  I won't tell you that it magically has gotten rid of all the wrinkles that I don't want to admit are there, however I can say that I see a difference in my skin in general since using this. The other thing that I will mention , is that my husband is starting to notice a difference, which says a lot by itself.

"Detangling Brush - Detangling Brush Works As a Detangler for Thick, Thin, Curly, Fine, Natural, Color Treated, Damaged, Wet or Dry Hair - No More Tangle - Adults &amp; Kids - Gentle As a Comb - Pink and Black Color - 100% SATISFICATION and LIFETIME GUARANTEE",4.0,"This fun cheetah style detangling brush does the job of detangling without pain in a little bit longer than a regular brush.

Firstly, this brush is slightly smaller than a standard paddle brush. It has bristles both small and long that are plastic and have a flat head. The brush handle is about 3-4 inches and easy to hold. The wording on the bristle side of the brush rubbed off after one use, but the color on the back of the brush (the cheetah print pattern) stays put.

When brushing through the hair, there is absolutely zero pain to the noggin even through tangles. I am able to use this on my one-year-old with curly hair to the middle of her back. I have straight hair all the way down to my hips that gets tangled like no other. This brush glides through tangles after a few repeated swipes with no pain whatsoever. There is no pulling feeling on the hair. The only hair that falls out is the hair that was naturally about to shed. It reduces my hair loss when compared to a regular brush by about 3/4!

The only negative to this brush is that it takes about 2-3x the standard amount of time I use to take using my other brush.  I need to repeatedly swipe certain areas to get out the tangles. In comparison, although my standard brush would take less time, it would be painful and make me lose more hair.

I swear while she is in school she gets a lice outbreak every 4 months. I have had the hardest time keeping them away. However, since I got this product I have not seen one more lice at all. My daughter did not like how it felt on her head the first time she used this product. She said it burned. I think it may have been more of a cooling feeling because of the peppermint oil ingredient. She has not complained since I read her the ingredients.

Set of 6: HBY8482; Solid Color Cotton Multi-Style Headbands for Women Sports or Fashion,3.0,"The headbands I received are NOT like the ones in the product image.  The product images (and some reviews) show 6 different colors, and a cotton-like fabric, but what I received was 4 different colors (2 grey, 2 brown, 1 navy, 1 black) made from shiny spandex swimsuit fabric. To make matters worse, none of them are stitched nicely, and I can see the glue that has oozed out under every HBY logo label.

I've attached some photos showing the hole on the underside of each band.  I understand that sometimes a hole is left in order to sew the seam and flip the whole thing inside out at the end, but in this case, ALL the stitching around ALL the holes on ALL 6 bands is loose and unraveling.  So there are literal and figurative loose ends here.

The headbands are comfortably roomy, so they make good hair accessories for washing your face and pushing your hair back.  But the lackluster workmanship, the cheap-feeling spandex fabric, and the fact that I didn't receive the diversity of colors that were advertised mean that I really can't give this more than 3 stars.

MY review is still my honest opinion. I have a ton of dark, thick curly hair. I am from California and it is super hot right now since it is summer. I really liked the colors these head bands came in. I really loved the navy and sky blue. I just personally do not like wearing the color brown. I feel like these head bands would be more cute and stylish, if they had less fabric at the top. I don't really like how the bunch fabric looks, but it isn't that bad. I mainly got these head bands to collect the sweat that this summer heat produces. I hate it when sweat run downs my face. It makes me feel dirty. I mainly wear them while I am cleaning my house or going out to the store in my tshirt and shorts. They keep my crazy hair from going into my face and bothering me. These headbands fir my head perfectly. I don't think I have a big head, but I bought another set of headbands on amazon and they did not fit my head and felt extremely uncomfortable. These are decent set of headbands. They are cute and get the job done.",A1YX4EVIFGRGAD,3.5,4.0,4.0

"Beneleaf Eye Cream For Dark Circles, Bags, Crows Feet &amp; Puffy Eyes - All Natural - 30ml/1oz.",5.0,"The first thing I noticed about Beneleaf eye gel is the smell.  Its a subdued scent of freshly mown grass and it fades as soon as you apply it so it won't interfere with your perfume.  It disperses easily from the pump bottle and feels cool as you apply it under your eyes.  It blends in quickly and leaves no residue so it won't interfere with applying makeup.  Ive had trouble with other eye gels that make my eyes water but not with Beneleaf.

Helps with under eye puffiness but I didn't notice any huge difference in under eye wrinkles though it does smooth them somewhat.  Also the pump puts out more than Id like to use unless Im hyper careful to press lightly.  Its made in the US which gets huge points for me.

Thanks to the manufacturer for providing a sample.",A3EXIZWHSNVNME,5.0,5.0,4.0

"Super Fruits Face Whip | Age Defying Cream Made with Organic Ingredients | Vitamin C | Peptides | AHA | Licorice Root | Best for Wrinkles, Dry Skin, Age Spots &amp; Younger, Firmer Looking Skin!",5.0,"My boyfriend and I have been both using this for about a week. He is 47 and I am 33. He has some lines around the eyes that really do seem to be smoothing out. They aren't as deep looking. I do not have any lines or wrinkles but I am using it to help my skin look smoother and hoping to remove some acne scars on my chin.

So far so good! My skin is looking softer and the acne scars are fading. I heard some can get irritation from AHA but neither of us have had any irritation and I have such sensitive skin. I do feel a little quick sting tingle mix right after applying but it lasts for a few seconds and does not hurt.

I am guessing that the other super food ingredients helps minimize the irritation that AHA can cause. A lot of these types of creams have chemicals in them and cost more! This is such a great price for such awesome ingredients.

Heed the directions and do a spot test because this stuff is potent and if you're allergic,  you DO NOT want this over your entire mouth.

"Ivation Portable Home Hair and Facial Steamer 2 in 1 Sauna Hot and Cool Mist Steam System Dual-Temperature Vaporizer, Ozone and Aromatherapy,White",5.0,"I never knew about hair steaming but from what I've read about it is is more beneficial for really curly and especially black hair. The steam does a few things, it hydrates the hair but it also relaxes and lifts the cuticle so that products, like conditioners, can better penetrate. If you have longer hair, it's best to lift it up and pin it so it can benefit from the steam, especially the ends that tend to be them most damaged. This steamer is easy to set up (my 10-year old did it) and starts to work quickly. It is designed so that the steam is spread out around the hood and doesn't just shoot up to the top. I like that it has the ability to be a facial steamer as well because investing in this for just the hair steamer might be a stretch for some. Having both features is an added benefit. Sample provided for review.",A1EVV74UQYVKRY,4.5,5.0,4.0
"Ivation Portable Home Hair and Facial Steamer 2 in 1 Sauna Hot and Cool Mist Steam System Dual-Temperature Vaporizer, Ozone and Aromatherapy,White",4.0,"This would be a 5-star review but for two things. 1) the attachements are at a fixed height. This means you have to either have a chair that can be raised or lowered, or you have to somehow move the entire unit so that it is placed just right. 2) the water reservior holds only enough water for about a 20 minute treatment, I think it could have been larger.

Negatives out of the way, I really like this ""spa at home"" device. A product like this is what some salons would use for either facial steaming or for hair treatments. The O3 (ozone) feature really puts this in the professional realm. You don't have to have it on, but it is there via a separate button. It is hard to judge, but O3 is supposed to help whatever treatment that has been applied to the hair 'soak in' more effectively. For the face, it just feels and smells good, especially if you add a drop or two of an essential oil like tea tree. Once you get the right height, the product is easy to use. You can fill it via the back dispenser or by removing the cup in the front. Afterwards, just wipe it all down after use and empty any remaining water. The warning tone when the session is over is a bit annoying, but just shut the unit off and it disappears. The Ivation 2-in-1 Tabletop Hair & Facial Steamer W/ozone is a great product for those who want the salon experience at home.

"Organic Bath Bomb Gift Set - 6 Extra Large 4.5-5 oz ea, not 2.5 oz size - Premium, Color Free Bath Bombs, Handcrafted in USA with Natural &amp; Organic Ingredients - Boxed &amp; Bowed, Ready To Give.",4.0,"&nbsp;Until I tried my first bath bomb I was not quite sure why it was called a Bath Bomb... I took a video and you can see that it fizzes like an explosion.  The scent is light and pleasant.  Each bomb is a one time use product, the entire bomb fizzes away in about 1 minutes leaving the scented water infused with a moisturiser.  I now tried a couple of different bath bombs, some generate bubbles like bubble bath but SpaGlo bombs do not.  There is a bit of foaming as the bomb fizzes and then the foam quickly disappears. Overall a very pleasant and relaxing experience.

What can be better?  The packaging is pretty but the teal netting on the package is covered with sparkles which fall off and it takes quite a bit of work to clean them up.  Sparkles give a pretty effect, but I hate the extra clean up - sparkles stick to the floors and counters and it took cleaning with a wet cloth Swiffer to get them all.  I would have been happier with a plain teal netting. This is a 5 star product, but I did not like the packaging. Based on my experience if you open the package on a newspaper you can avoid the clean up.

This bath bomb is provided by SpaGo.

"Organic Bath Bomb Gift Set - 6 Extra Large 4.5-5 oz ea, not 2.5 oz size - Premium, Color Free Bath Bombs, Handcrafted in USA with Natural &amp; Organic Ingredients - Boxed &amp; Bowed, Ready To Give.",5.0,"Up until this year I only used bath salts. I liked how soft they made the water and how fragrant my bath was with the bath salts. I did not think I needed anything else for my baths. Turned out, I was wrong. I tried bath bombs because they were offered at a discount and was immediately hooked. Unlike bath salts, bath bombs moisturize your skin during bath and take your bath experience to the next level. But not all bath bombs are the same.

Spa Glo bath bombs are ones of the best. They moisturize the skin wonderfully due to their shea butter and cocoa butter content. They smell awesome!  I could not even pick which one I like the best, they are all great!  I usually do not care a lot for the visual effects of the bath bombs, like vivid colors and glitters but I realize that for other people these might be important. The packaging of Spa Glo bath bomb sets are the prettiest that I have seen. I just love the handmade glittered tulle bow with a sparkly heart. My severely autistic son who does not play with toys quickly got the hold of them from both Spa Glo sets, pink and blue. And the sets were wrapped in a pretty tissue paper. Packaging with such an attention for details makes these bath bombs sets perfect for a gift giving but the bath bombs smell so amazing that it would be hard to give them away, so get some for yourself as well.

12oz Magnesium Oil with ALOE VERA - LESS ITCHY - Made in USA - Get Healthy Hair &amp; Skin and Sleep Better! || FREE eBook Included (New),5.0,"I take magnesium supplements to help alleviate threats like heart disease, stroke, osteoporosis and diabetes.  As I'm not much of a pill taker, I switched to liquid, but then progressed to magnesium oil for better transdermal absorption.  I like this form, but find it leaves my skin feeling itchy.  Seven Minerals gave me a free sample of magnesium oil with aloe vera to try, and I've found it's a great solution.  Applying to the soles of my feet works best, but I've used it elsewhere and find little to no irritation.

The salt used in Seven Minerals is sourced from the Great Salt Lake.  I was concerned about possible mercury contamination and contacted the company about their purification process.  What a surprise to get an immediate response with detailed information, including testing analysis from their supplier.  This product is free of organic volatile impurities and heavy metal detection is insignificant (less than 0.001%).

This is the first time I've used magnesium oil with aloe vera, and I'm impressed.  It's a little pricey, but the 12 oz. bottle lasts a long time and I love the convenience of a spray bottle that works well.",A3C2JQC6R2K52C,4.6,5.0,4.0

12oz Magnesium Oil with ALOE VERA - LESS ITCHY - Made in USA - Get Healthy Hair &amp; Skin and Sleep Better! || FREE eBook Included (New),3.0,"I am a woman with MS who deals with muscle spasms.  This was something I was trying to test this product on.  My partner also has restless-legs and she tried the product too.

Having given the product time and hoping for the best, we did not notice any benefit.  We tried various ways of using it as instructed - on the bottom of the feet before bed as well as using it on the spot for muscle spasms or aching joints.  The consistency is oily and a bit sticky and takes some getting accustomed to.  On only one instance did I notice some ""itchiness"".  My magnesium levels (via blood test) have been checked in the past four months are are ok.

Although we really really wanted to like this product and give it 5 stars, I cannot find the benefit that I was expecting.  If it works for you, great.

I was provided a sample to test and provide an honest opinion.  We tried it in many scenarios and for us ... did not seem to provide visible or tangible benefit.",A2OBDNQ5ZYU1L8,4.6,3.0,4.0
12oz Magnesium Oil with ALOE VERA - LESS ITCHY - Made in USA - Get Healthy Hair &amp; Skin and Sleep Better! || FREE eBook Included (New),5.0,"I've never used magnesium in a spray before I received this complimentary sample of Seven Minerals Magnesium oil (for review purposes). Lack of magnesium can cause muscle cramps and heart palpitations, menstrual cramps, restless legs and constipation (Milk of Magnesia is an anti-constipation medicine). It's most common in people who do a lot of sports or sweat a lot from working outdoors, but as much as 80% of people are low in magnesium. Magnesium is found naturally in green leafy vegetables, cashew nuts and pumpkin seeds, and some legumes like black beans, but many people don't eat enough of these foods to get sufficient magnesium.

Magnesium ""oil"", which is not really an oil (it's magnesium chloride), is found in brine harvested from ancient sea beds, and can be absorbed through the skin. It's more easily absorbed by our bodies this way than through taking an oral supplement. I've used Seven Minerals Magnesium oil for about a week now, and as with many vitamin and mineral supplements it's hard to say it's definitely working. I spray it on my feet and let it dry before I go to bed. I don't notice the itching some reviews have noted, but I have noticed that my restless/twitchy legs have been better since I started using it. The aloe vera added to this product soothes the skin and helps counteract the salt, although I also use a moisturizer on my feet after the spray has dried.

I believe this is a convenient and effective way to add magnesium to your body, and people with more severe cramping issues could find some relief from it. Because my diet is pretty balanced already, I didn't see huge benefits but I do feel it helped with my restless legs at night.",AEC90GPFKLAAW,4.6,5.0,4.0

"ClipPro Cuticle Nipper &frac12;&rdquo; Jaw - Brushed Stainless Steel, Handle Lock",4.0,"This 4 1/2"" x 1 3/4"" (latched) KlipPro 1/4"" Jaw Cuticle Nipper does a really nice job of removing my cuticles cleanly and without  injury.
The 1/4"" Jaws feature a 3/16"" Bevel on the Tips which allows me to get under and between areas which are usually difficult to trim.
The Tips of the Blades are Super Sharp and they sit tightly together when closed, with no gaps or jagged areas.
I appreciate that the Jaw can be opened to a full 5/8"" and the tension of the Lever Spring is just enough to put a little muscle behind the Jaw, allowing it to cut more efficiently.
There is an easy to manipulate Locking Safety Latch which holds the two handles together and keeps the Jaw with blades locked together in the closed position.
KlipPro Personal Care Products includes a Silicone Safety Cap which fits over the Jaw to protect the blades and prevent injury while being stored.
This KlipPro 1/4"" Jaw Cuticle Nipper is Nicely Packaged and would make a great gift.
I received mine at a discounted cost in exchange for testing and offering my honest, unbiased opinion.
It's Definitely one of the Better Cuticle Nipper's I have tried in this price range.  Highly Recommend!",A3LX2VT91TE1M1,4.0,4.0,4.0

bliss Fabgirlslim Hide and Go Sleek Tinted Body Spray,4.0,"I love all the Bliss Fatgirlslim products I have ever bought or tried. Fatgirlsleep is by far my fave product of the line and one of my most favorite body products, period - it is the best. This product here, Hide and Glow Sleek is ok. As a self tanner, it is a great product. it goes on surprisingly even, dries super fast and has no scent at all that I could smell. It reminds me of a light airbrush spray, so it is very easy to work with and get nice, even color. I am very pale and I got the medium to deep shade and it does not look orange at all. I am sure if you spray it too heavily, too quickly, it might, but I ended up with  very nice color and not very dark at all - I didn't want anything too drastic. It gave me just the right amount of color to take away the paleness. I love self  tanning products since I am so fair skinned, but it is hard to find many that work well and not look fake or orange or too dark. It takes me awhile to build up a natural tan, so I always start the season with self tanners. As just a tanner, I like this one since the color is nice, even, and you don't even have to use your hands to apply it. You could just spray and go.

The directions state to spray even strokes down the leg, but I didn't really go in straight lines like that. It is a very fine spray, so it applies very nicely and lightly, so you can build up the color if you want. Once I spray an area, I kinda give it a once over with my hand to smooth and/or blend it and it already feels dry and doesn't even need any blending. It has a very faint shimmer to it, which is what helps the ""sleek"" effect. The light reflects off those particles and helps to hide imperfections - like an optical illusion. I am not one for shimmery or glittery body products, but this is very minimal and I don't mind it at all.

As for the firming aspect, I don't think it is as good as the original Fatgirlslim cream or Fatgirlsleep (sleep version is fabulous, im telling you!) but it does make your skin feel smooth. I don't think it has the tightening effect that the creams do. It may be hard to deliver in a spray like this, especially if you use it lightly. Overall, though, I do like it and I will continue to use it. If I notice any further tightening effects as more time passes, I will update my review. With the Bliss creams, it is immediate so I expected the same with this spray.

As a tanner, I'd give it 5 stars
As a slimming/tightening/firming product, I'd give it 3 to 4-ish stars so far. The effects of the shimmer reducing the appearance of cellulite and dimples allows for the rating to be closer to 4 stars.

If you really want to feel your skin tighter and lose the appearance of dimples, try Fatgirlslim or Fatgirlsleep. Your skin will say thank you!!",A1QBOC76MIOJYP,3.5,4.0,4.0
bliss Fabgirlslim Hide and Go Sleek Tinted Body Spray,3.0,"Let's be honest ladies, in the year 2015, do you really think you will spray a liquid on your skin and look magically skinnier? If you do, this product is FOR YOU! It makes you suddenly go from Stay Puft Marshmallow Man into Kate Upton. That's right!

Now for the 'rest of us', this product is just silly. I am a fan of a lot of bliss products. This one turned my stomach. I volunteered to try it out for an honest review. I found the color to be ok. It goes on quickly and easily. The odor isn't very bad, the color is fine. It is just like many lotion-type tanning products I've used. the sprayer works really good.

With that said, if you are looking to have perfectly smoothed out thighs once you spray this on, then do not spend your money. Yes, skin does tighten, but it is like spraying alcohol on your face and then waiting while the skin pulls taught. This can't work enough to pull out dimples. Certainly not many dimples. Look elsewhere to cover your cellulite. I suggest a longer bathing suit or sarong.",AHRNDSKWH1YBT,3.5,3.0,4.0
bliss Fabgirlslim Hide and Go Sleek Tinted Body Spray,5.0,"Never having used a tinted body spray/product before, I was not sure what to expect. Well, maybe I actually did expect the worse. A formula that didn't dry quickly, stained my clothing, and turned me orange is what I was fearing. However, this spray has me pleasantly surprised. The spray is lightweight and dries quickly upon application. I have fair skin and the fair to medium glow gave me just a little color (which I appreciated) and did help to even out my skin tone (it helped to diminish the darker areas from previous exposure to the sun and also age spots). The spray also has an extremely light scent; you can barely tell it is there, even directly after applying the product. This is good for my sensitive skin, and also, for those who use them, will not clash with cologne and other scented body products. And, it did not rub off onto my clothing, either.

I seem to be in the minority as far as my rating for this product, but I have to base my review on my own personal experience. Some other reviews have mentioned using a less expensive product, such as Jergens. I cannot use almost all of the Jergens skincare products, as they cause severe dermatitis, which ends up in a trip to the doctor's office (I am not talking mild irritation, here). I do not think the price for this product is exorbitant, either.  If you plan on using this product daily, then I suppose it could get expensive. For myself, I will use this spray occasionally, when I want my entire body (and not just my face) to benefit from a little glow and a little color, especially during the warmer weather. I also believe you get what you pay for. As I already stated, this tinted body spray does not aggravate my allergy prone skin, and I am sure that is probably due to better ingredients in a higher quality product. I think this spray is good value for the money, and would definitely purchase it for myself or another member of my family (and, yes, the skin sensitivity is hereditary and runs in my family).",A29VG90T649CSU,3.5,5.0,4.0
bliss Fabgirlslim Hide and Go Sleek Tinted Body Spray,2.0,"I have to agree with previous posters about the smell/spray/aerosol thing. I've used tanning lotions and while I have often bemoaned the streaky look sometimes left behind, I actually prefer that method of application. This is some strong stuff and I wondered what I was breathing. Spraying this in the bathroom resulted in a coughing fit. It's as bad as hairspray--okay, worse.

The color is super subtle. I'm not sure I'm actually seeing any tint at all or just imagining it because I expect it to be there.

It does not do anything as far as making me look slimmer or hiding stretch marks or anything like that.

I don't think I would purchase this stuff though it is easy to apply.",A3THYM7XMB8B0U,3.5,2.0,4.0
bliss Fabgirlslim Hide and Go Sleek Tinted Body Spray,4.0,"I'm reviewing ""medium to deep glow"" shade, trying it out on some really pasty white legs.

Sprays on easily with a very handy 360 spray can that works from all angles including upside down.  Nice light feel.  No offensive scent.  Results?

On those oh-so-white legs, I was disappointed to see a hint of orange.  This is an important negative, BUT, I'm thinking the major problem here (regarding the orange hue) is that I was applying the medium/deep tinted product on very white skin.  I think I would have got more desirable results with the ""light to medium"" tint.  (Save ""the medium to deep glow"" shade for skin with already some color).  Realistically, I was just looking for enough color so as not to be embarrassed, I really wasn't trying for a well-tanned look.  The application did leave a nice sheen that looked reasonably healthy, and not flashy or ridiculous.  The glow combined with the color does indeed help camouflage pale and dimpled skin.  As I said, if you are working on pasty white areas, go with the lighter shade selection.  Hangs in there a couple of days, but will shower off.

Now, about the ""firming"" aspect. Felt great going on - nice and light.  I can imagine, I suppose,  some sensation of firming.  But even the manufacturer suggests, ""For best firming results, use every day . . . in conjunction with regular exercise, a healthy diet . . ."" (you get the picture).

An easy- to-use product that does give immediate, though temporary results - leaving a nice more healthy look.  You'll have to pay attention to shade selection, and application technique.",AW7BIYHXUIZ62,3.5,4.0,4.0

This item was shipped promptly and packaged appropriately for an essential oil. I am an African-American female with naturally kinky-curly hair texture. I frequently concoct my own hair cream recipes instead of spending needless money for store-shelf products. I'm always in search of a good quality essential oil and after purchasing ""KALLITHIA"" Argan Oil I've found a perfect addition to my haircare product arsenal. I love the fact that it is much lighter than jojoba and even coconut oil. As with any oil though you can overdo it so I make sure to use it sparingly; with this quality oil a little goes a long way! I found the best application method with it is to place a drop or three into my hands, rub it warm, and apply throughout my strands for an even distribution. The results give me ultra shine and a unique softness that lasts a couple of days before I need to reapply.

D.J Hair Styling Pomade (Cream) -  Matte Look  - Professional Formula - The Best Hair Clay for Elastic and Strong Hold - Big Box (7.4 Oz),5.0,"This comes in a large container. It was a lot larger than I was expecting. It works well. It is a little hard to get out because of its tackiness and hardness. However, you just push your finger in and scrape some up and you will have it. You do not need to use much for most styles, depending on what type of style you're going for. I rub a little bit of this cream in between my fingertips and then rub it into the area of my hair that I want. It holds very well. I used this on my son's hair when he wanted a particular style. It turned out quite well. This is not sticky or greasy at all. It also does not get stiff. It looks and feels natural. It has a nice scent for men. My son likes it a lot and he uses it most days. I used it a couple times too. The scent is not strong or noticeable.

I like how natural your hair looks after using this. It does not leave your hair shiny or greasy. It looks very natural, as if you used nothing at all. Remember not to grab too much. However, if a little bit doesn't seem like enough for your particular hairstyle, then you can always grab some more. Rub it into your palms or fingertips first before applying it. I have bought the professional hair salon pomades and hair creams before. This works just as well as any of those, maybe even better since it's non-greasy and looks natural. Furthermore, this package is a lot bigger than what you usually get in the hair salons. So I think you definitely get your money's worth from this. I was so glad to be able to buy this product while they had a promotion going on. I think this is a great cream for getting that particular look or definition you want. They give you plenty of it too. This is well worth your money. In addition, it does not leave any white flakes in your hair. I have experienced that from other products. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.

Ps.  If this product is too solid or hard for you to use, just add a teaspoon of water and mix. You may want to let it sit with the water overnight to help soften it up. It then should be easy to use.",A1BRCVMQ7C9CGJ,5.0,5.0,4.0
"dr. brandt Cellusculpt, 6.3 fl. oz.",4.0,"In the years that I've worried about cellulite, I've been told that it's a problem that doesn't have a real lasting fix.  But this doesn't keep me from trying different possible products that might help even if they don't fully rid ""solve"" or eliminate cellulite altogether.  It's in this spirit that I tried out Dr Brandt's Cellusculpt.

The cream comes in secure packaging, carefully sealed to prevent it from spilling during transit. With product this expensive, it's good to know that it will arrive in good condition.  You only need a little bit of cream at a time, so I expect that the tube should last me several months with careful application.  I've been applying a pea size for each troublespot (each thigh and the backside).  It leaves a slightly cooling and tingly feeling which lasts for a bit.  I found that it makes me more conscious of the area as well, encouraging me to do more spot exercises, which is a good thing.  I haven't noticed any significant reduction in the cellulite in the week that I've used it. It compares well to the Estee Lauder Body Performance Slim Shape Anti-Cellulite Visible Contouring Cream that I'd used in the past. I'd say it is just as effective.",A19KLUZ1XD3SRN,4.0,4.0,4.0

I've been using it about a week, and so far, it seems to be working.  The back of my thighs and buttocks area seems to be smoothing a little bit.  I'm anxious to see how it looks after a few months.

The cream itself has a very strong scent, and smells like a medicated cream a little bit.  But it's not unpleasant, I find it oddly relaxing.  A little bit goes a long way, which I like, given how expensive the cream is.  The applicator is really nice, and very easy to use.  It has a nice sensation with the rolling balls when applying it.  The only thing is the cream comes out of the center, and you have to use your finger to get the last little bit off and apply it to your skin, because even pressing firmly, there will still be excess on the applicator.  But no big deal.

Overall this is a great product, and I would highly recommend it.",A35LT14WG5BX0T,4.0,5.0,4.0

Brandt Celluscript could remove the cellulite from the backs of my thighs. I always hope for a miracle. It would be great if I could just apply a cream and the cellulite would just dissolve away and my thighs would look like they belonged to a twenty-something instead of those of a woman whose age is an unlisted number. Well, this cream went on easily and the applicator with the little round bearings in the top that roll over the skin while dispensing the cream are kind of unique. And the cream has sort of a medicinal fragrance which smells like serious stuff for cellulite melting. But even after using it a couple times per day, not a lot of improvement is seen. It does act as a good moisturizer, so my skin is a little smoother. But my thighs aren't sculpted or smaller in any way and the cellulite is still there. I will continue to use it, but I will be very surprised if the cellulite is actually affected.",A3S3R88HA0HZG3,4.0,3.0,4.0

I so far have not seen a difference in cellulite, and I've used it correctly.  The tube, in the open position has a center top opening to squeeze out the product.  The metal rollerballs around the center are for reshaping your fat cells.

I personally wasn't sure of the smell, but my husband said I smelled musky in a good way.  He said I smelled nice.

Just a little product goes a long way.  I might buy this again.  I have eczema, and this product goes right into your skin and won't rub off like emollients.

Maybe I'm just a difficult case, being 60 and overweight.  It is a bit jiggly and awkward going on certain spots.  But is is an overall good product in my opinion.

After 4 weeks it is said on the box that:
96% reported skin texture improvement. - check
96% reported skin was more toned and firmer - check
84% reported hips and thighs are sculpted
80% reported  cellulite appearance minimized

I'm sure I would buy this just for skin firmness to and hydration.

Sexy Straight Smooth and Seal Hair Spray 8.1 Ounce (Pack of 3),5.0,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,AY8XPOPF0OVO5,4.818181818181818,5.0,4.0

I don't know why I have never gotten this before now!! My lashes look amazing and they are mine, not falsie.  I have gotten many compliments on it!  It is so easy to apply and it last all day long!! It doesn't clump and it doesn't irritate!

It is really easy to use, you first apply the transfer gel onto your eyelash and right after you will apply your fibers.  After you have done that, you apply another coat of your transfer gel.  You can repeat those steps as many times as you like.  This does make your lashes longer and fuller.

If you are on the fence about purchasing this item, let me assure you that you want to and you will love it as much as I have!!!

"Exquisite Eyes 3D Fiber Lashes Mascara, Water Resistant, Brush On Black Eyelash Extensions Instantly, Non Toxic Natural Ingredients, 300% Increase in Volume and Length, 30 Day Money Back Guarantee, Sold Exclusively by Ultra Beauty Essentials",4.0,"This is easy to apply and use. It takes a little longer because of the two products you need to apply and the extra steps to achieve the look you want, though. The first step is some sort of mascara gel. You have to use that step before you can use the second step. You have to apply the second tube, which are the fibers immediately after using the first tube. You then can do all the steps over again to get more fibers to stick to your eyelashes. The fiber tube is dry so you must apply it quickly after applying the mascara gel. Do one eye completely before doing the second eye. I wish this came with a dry eyelash brush for when I am completely done with all the steps. My eyelashes started to clump but if you have, an eyelash brush than you can fix that problem and your eyelashes will look beautiful.

I have never tried any sort of fiber mascara before so I was thrilled to buy this at a discount. It comes with good instructions, which I really appreciated. The instructions say you can apply your regular mascara first, if you want too, so I tried that. I liked the results better this way. I also could then see the added length from the fibers. The fibers do seem to fall down onto your face as the day goes on though. You will get little flexes but they are so tiny it really wasn't a big deal to me. I wish the fibers were not so dry though but I guess that is why it comes with a gel that you're supposed to apply first.  I love the packaging and the box this comes in. It's so cute and it feels like the box has a magnet closure, which is really nice.

When I was offered the opportunity to receive these KlipPro Personal Care Products Eyebrow Tweezers in exchange for testing and review,
I accepted in hopes that I would finally own a quality pair of easy to use Eyebrow Tweezers.
So Happy To Report That KlipPro Did Not Disappoint!
The Ergonomic Design of these Eyebrow Tweezers make them so Easy to Grip! I have arthritis in my fingers and I am so pleased to finally own a pair of tweezers that allow me to hold them Comfortably for the duration of time it takes to pluck my unruly brows.
I love that these KlipPro Tweezers are Longer and Wider than other tweezers I own. The  3.8"" x 0.6"" x 0.5"" dimensions make them Easier to Manipulate without the frustration of slipping or twisting that I have experienced with shorter, thinner tweezers.
The Slanted Tips of these tweezers allows for a Firm Hold of my eyebrow hairs, and I appreciate that they Sit Flush along the entire tip.
So nice to own a pair of tweezers that allows me to utilize the Entire Tip and not just the portions where the blades happen to come together.
I also love that these KlipPro Tweezers are made of Rust and Tarnish Resistant Stainless Steel. I expect them to last a very long time.

My skin  peels like it should after. Well this time I had a stubborn dry spot under my eye. The next morning after using this product the dry spot was smooth as a babies behind. Amazing!!! I use the vitamin c serum the glycolic acid cream and now this all from Toulon. My skin glows!!! I have a stubborn fine line under my eye after 4 days yes four days it is going away!! I can't believe it. I can use these products twice a day but if your skin is sensitive I suggest once a day. I can't wait to see the results after 30 days. I know that fine line I can't stand will be gone!! Since using these products I have not needed botox or my retina cream. These work better!! I am so excited that I ran across these products that I will use for life. My acne is gone now my fine lines around my eyes are ironing out too. Also my bb cream glides on. My eyeliner went on so smoothly. I can't live without these 3 life changing products. Also the customer service is outstanding!!! I have never had a company care so much about what I think about the product. No department store product works like Toulon. Nothing I ever got from the spa works as well. My retina is out of date because I am using these with better results. Also no department store will care about you the way Toulon does. I know because I worked for a major department store brand!!! I thank you Toulon. I love this eye cream. I highly recommend all of these products. When used together Wow factor!!I can't for Toulon to make something else...a scar cream.

Other than that, if you use just a bit, because a bit goes a long way, and massage it into your skin, you may find it is extremely relaxing feeling! I don't think it permanently gets rid of cellulite, but I do think it temporarily reduces the look of it. I am not sure how, but it helps with the appearance. I am really happy with this, It is warming and nice feeling when used in the right amounts, and has some effects on appearance.

Advanced BioScience Vitamin C Serum and Phytoceramides,5.0,"FIRST OFF, IIVE TRIED QUITE A FEW VITAMIN C CREAMS AND SERUMS IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO, THEY ARE  VERY POPULAR, AND I LOVE THIS ONE FROM Advanced BioScience I THINK THE LITTLE BIT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SERUMS IS THAT RHIS ONE HAS COQ10. I HAVENT SEEN THAT UNGREDIENT IN OTHER VITAMIN C SERUMS THAT I HAVE TRIED.

IVE BEEN SEEING LOTS OF ARTICLES AND POSTS ON VITAMIN C SERUMS AND CREAMS IN MAGAZINE ARTICLES, ON LINE, ON TELEVISION, AND ON BLOGS, SO I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY AND IM ABSOLUTELY AMAZED WITH THE RESULTS THAT I AM STARTING TO EXPeRIENCE!! THISN ONE IS ANPITTPE ABOVE THE REST WITH THE ADDED PHYTOCERAMIDES in this COMBINED PACK! THATS AN AWRSOMR COMBINATION!

AT THIS POINT IVE TRIED 6 DIFFERENT TOPICAL VITAMIN C'S, THIS BEING MY SIXTH, VITAMIN C PRODUCT, AND FOURTH THAT IS A SERUM AND NOT A CREAM.

I HAVE A REALLY BIG BELLY BUTTON SCAR FROM MY TUBLIGATION, AND THIS IS THE THIRD SERUM THAT I TRIED ON IT. I AM ON DAY 9 OF USING THIS VITAMIN C PRODUCT,. THIS IS WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH THE PREVIOUS VITAMIN C SERUMS AND WIlllWITH THIS ONE TOO AS I AM ALREADY NOTICING A CHANGE ON DAY 3. FIRST, I STARTED OFF USING THE SERUM ONLY ONCE A DAY TO SEE IF I ACTUALLY SEE RESULTS, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT AGREES WITH MY SKIN AS WELL. AFTER 3 DAYS OF USING IT MY SCAR HAD NOTICABLY LIGHTENED UP AND I HAD NO TROUBLE USING IT, SO I INCREASED MY DAILY USAGE UP TO TWO TIMES A DAY, I WOULD APPLY IT IN THE MORNING BEFORE GETTING DRESSED AND AGAIN AT NIGHT BEFORE BED. I HAVE 5 CHILDREN, SO I DO NOT HAVE A SET SHOWERING SCHEDULE, I THROW ONE IN WHEN I CAN, SO OBVIOUSLY WEATHER IT WAS MORNING OR NIGHT I APPLIED THE VITAMIN C AFTER MY SHOWER.

THIS ADVANCE BIOSCIENCE VITAMIN C SERUM IS A CLEARISH LIKE IN COLOR SERUM AND HAS A THICKER SERUM TEXTURE. I LOVE THAT IT IS NOT COMPLETELY THIN!

Zigabob Callus Remover For Feet...Rechargeable...Blue,5.0,"I have to say that I wish I could afford to go get a pedicure a couple times a month, but that simply isn't in my budget!  So having this callus remover is the next best thing.
I own a couple different styles of these, and I have to say that this one is my favorite.  I love the fact that it is rechargeable, so I don't have to worry about buying batteries for it.  I have teenagers in the house and it seems as though I can never keep batteries around.  The Zigabob Callus Remover comes with an extra head in the box, which is a big plus to me.  I used this straight out of the shower, and I have to say I was really impressed at how well it worked. The motor on this is powerful enough to actually get the dead skin off your feet!  Yet at the same time, it was gentle to those areas of my feet that are a little bit more sensitive
It comes with a little brush , so when you are all done, you can clean it off easily.  I personally love the fact that it is waterproof!  The best time to use this type of tool on your feet is either in the shower or directly after getting out.
I even used this on my husbands feet, which are just yuck!!!  I was super impressed that it actually worked on his feet!!  This is the best thing I have ever got for our feet care in a long time!!

"Eyelash Growth Serum, Rapid Lash Growth, EyeBrow Growth (4 ml) 6 Months Supply. Best EyeLash Growth Products, EyeLash Enhancer for &amp; Brow Thickener. Longer Lashes &amp; Thicker Eyebrows",5.0,"Personally I enjoy lash and brow serums, I even make my own and I did like this product. I have been using it for several months, and Im lazy so I cant say I used it every night but when I did manage to give my skin a spa ending I would always run this along my top lashes and through my brows. Interestingly enough I found that this made my lashes grow longer, I could really see the difference when applying mascara ( LOreal Telescopic ) and they would be much longer than usually, especially in the center of my eye, it also helped with some broken ones I had on my right eye towards the outer edge from a cheap curler, which chopped them off. That happened to me more than once, and it took months to grow them back, before it took so long I stopped hoping but this serum seemed to make that time a lot shorter and made me realize how different parts of my lash line are vulnerable from makeup tools.

It stings a little if you let it get into your eye through careless application, so go easy but so far Im really enjoying it, and it feels natural, not chemical, when its on my skin its almost like water and feels fresh. I believe apple has been used in this, to stimulate the growth and its made in the USA.  This might not work on everyone, since nothing ever does but I had great results, count me as a happy camper  :)

"Eyelash Growth Serum, Rapid Lash Growth, EyeBrow Growth (4 ml) 6 Months Supply. Best EyeLash Growth Products, EyeLash Enhancer for &amp; Brow Thickener. Longer Lashes &amp; Thicker Eyebrows",5.0,"We have all seen the commercials for the product that increases eyelash growth and it's something that we all want and/or need. Well, more like want! I'm not going to see my doctor to discuss my healthy lashes and then pay for a prescribed product. That is just not happening here! I can see though, like purchasing a mascara doing the same when it comes to using a serum. I buy serums for my skin, so why not buy something for my lashes too?

VIDI is a skincare company that offers an eyelash/eyebrow serum as part of their beauty line. This is my first time working with VIDI and they were kind enough to send me the product to give it a 4-week try.

IncreduLASH is a product that nourishes your own natural eyelashes and promotes growth, plus it comes with 0% of the risks and side effects, which are associated with other products on the market, including the prescribed brands. Permanent darkening of my eye's skin is not something I am willing to risk when the dark circles look is not my cup of tea! It's a serum that can be applied to encourage growth to your eyebrows in case you plucked one too many in your lifetime or with age, we tend to start getting growth that is no longer fuller or longer in length. I'm so far so good when it comes to my lashes and thankfully I was blessed with both eyebrows that are as full as my lashes. I just wanted to enhance the look and also test how effective and how quick it worked. It took me 3 months to get Coconut oil to show it's effects on my eyebrows when I read they need to be moisturized too. Eyebrow gels, cosmetics, and anything you use to temporarily darken or make your eyebrows look fuller and thicker......well, they tend to stress them out too. Yup, that means you get thinning and just loss of hairs and lashes, which then means you need more cosmetics to get the look you want that is being compromised by the product(s) you use (the never ending cycle).  I use a clear eyebrow gel and I noticed that my skin, plus the hairs get dehydrated over time. I then started to apply oils to my eyebrows but this is only something I can do at night, as oily eyebrows is not something I have heard is the ""gotta have it"" look at the moment :).

Application:
Simple to apply and like anything you use in that area, just watch it when it comes to getting it in your eye. Hey, even Coconut oil hurts when it starts travelling into my eye! You simply take the wand and brush along the eye's skin where your lashes start (the root, per say). One continuous stroke on each eye and done. You also apply the serum after freshly washing your face because the surface must be clean and free of anything else, like with most serums should be applied to any skin area (i.e. thinner product in texture gets applied first). You only use it once a day too, so it really is easy to work into any beauty regimen. For eyebrow use, the same application principle as your eyes applies and make sure the product dries and absorbs before applying anything else.

Verdict:
I added IncreduLASH to my nightly beauty routine and used it only once a day on my lashes. I use the product as a ""spot corrector"" on one eyebrow because I had an ""oops"" while plucking and created a spot that was missing 2 to 3 hairs. Yes, my spot would eventually yield hairs again but I'm a girl that has little patience when it comes to my boo-boos being corrected. The serum by VIDI states most start seeing results within 2 weeks. I can say by 2.5 weeks, my lashes felt and looked nicer. I had zero stragglers like when you have those mini lashes that began to grow and they are too short to notice before you apply mascara, but then obstruct your vision once you do! Those mini lashes drive me crazy and I then have to use the mascara wand's tip to make them stick to a lash-buddy that is of normal length......I have also plucked them when they don't play nice. Yes, it starts the process of growing again but I then hope the new lash heard the screams of the last lash being plucked and will behave :). It was nice not having to deal with shorties, so that was a definite positive that I saw from IncreduLASH's results. I also found the texture of the hairs were enhanced I lost less when I curled my lashes and/or washed the mascara off. Sometimes I even lost none! Next, the spot on my eyebrow. What spot? By week three the spot was a thing of the pass and from my experience, it would take me a month and a half to see those mistakes show any hairs that are long enough and I did not need to blot some eyebrow pencil to cover it up. IncreduLASH does work and because you use so little product upon application, it makes the investment sting less when it comes to sticker price. I use less mascara and like this natural fuller lash look that did not need a doctor's visit to get. I'm a DIY gal and especially when it comes to beauty solutions and IncreduLASH is a soultion that works, plus VIDI guarantees it! I received the above product(s) free of charge from VIDI (IncreduLASH).  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.

Detangling Hairbrush &ndash; Gentle Detangler Hair Brush &amp; Comb &ndash; No More Tangle &ndash; Reduce Hair Loss and Breakage &ndash; Great for Adults &amp; Kids &ndash; Lime Green,5.0,"I've had a couple of versions of this style of detangling brush.
Do they work? YES!
Do they last? NO!

Except for this one. It has outperformed the others.
First, a bit about these brushes. They come in a number of shapes and paddles, but are similar in that they have the same kind of plastic bristles.
The bristles stagger in length, and painlessly smooth knots and tangles.
Most of the time the bristles start to bend and then the brush is useless. After months of hard use, this one is still good as new.

These are a favorite with parents of kids with unruly hair, because they don't hurt.
I like it for myself, and it's also my 'secret weapon'.

I have 2 Maltese dogs, one is in full coat. That means long, flowing hair to the ground. Most people with a Malt in full coat need to section off the coat and roll up the hair, otherwise it gets so tangled it needs to be cut.

Italia Deluxe Ultra Fine Lip Liner set (Pack Of 12),5.0,"Wow.  I am so impressed with these lip pencils.  Despite all the great reviews, I never expected them to be as good as they are.  I'm seriously wondering what's wrong with them that I'm missing, because they hit the nail on the head when it comes to quality lip pencils.

Only one color is, to me, unusable--it's an orangey-red that I think would make anyone's teeth look very yellow.  The other colors are perfect!  Unlike most pencil sets, there aren't any that are too ""brown"" or ""yellow"" or ""orange"".  They are all lovely.

I am pretty conservative/neutral with my lip color but am trying to ""branch out"" a bit and use darker pigments.  None of these are so dark that they'd be inappropriate for a 45-year old woman like me.  They ARE very pigmented and go on incredibly smooth.  They don't stay on all day for me, but considering that they also don't dry my lips out, I'm okay with having to reapply once or twice.

Italia Deluxe Ultra Fine Lip Liner set (Pack Of 12),5.0,What a great deal for so many liners!! I have my favorites.

They glide on your lips. No dragging or pulling. Yes you have to sharpen them but well worth it. These are extremely long pencils too!! I really love that I can experiment now with different color lipsticks. I got stuck in a nude color lipstick rut for a while. Now I can expand my horizons! These are wonderful pencils. I do love the nude same color as my lip the two pinks one a dusty rose also the color of my lip and hot pink which is a Barbie pink And a light nude brown which also just pops a little color on my lips. I am extremely pleased with the quality of these pencils. I have bought inexpensive lip liners and they tug across your lip ouch!! Not these!!

One of my favorite products to test out (besides masks of course) is hand cream!  I cannot even tell you how many hand creams I have tested over the years.  I'm fairly picky about my hand creams, however, I also like a variety of hand creams to choose from.  Sometimes I want a light hand cream that absorbs quickly and other times I want a nice and thick hand cream that will just sit and kind of marinate on my hands and then eventually soak in.  I also like a hand cream that falls somewhere in between.  Where I am and what I am doing always influences what kind of hand cream I use.
This Hand Cream by LeiaSea has been my one and only ""go-to"" Hand Cream for several weeks now!  Which is kind of amazing since I have about 5 different ones that I use on an everyday basis.  It just provides the perfect amount moisture to my overly dry hands without feeling greasy and also leaves them feeling incredibly soft and silky.  I also really like the light, fresh scent and a little goes a long way so that is a bonus too!  I've also been using it on my feet and it has really helped soothe and heal my dry, cracked heels.  The Leliasea Hand Cream definitely gets a 5-Star rating from me!

So for us, there was nothing special here.  It soaped fine, lathered fine, didn't dry out skin, but so to many, many other products out there that cost considerably less than this per bar.",ABQWMANK4AR63,4.732456140350878,3.0,4.0

This is a big bar of soap that should last quite a long time.  I love the scent that comes off of the bar; just keeping it in the shower fills the our ensuite bathroom smell so appealing and lovely.  At first I was able to apply the bar directly to my skin, and then the course particles were brought to the surface!  It is very scratchy and painful if you are not careful.  Now we either apply to a loofah or just lather in our hands.

The lather on this bar is great as is the scent but like all bars of soap it gives you that slick feeling which we hate.  It is also very dangerous when rinsing this soap off of your body or applying directly to your feet because it makes your tub feel like an ice skating rink.  Imagine pouring hair conditioner onto your tub floor...  scary!  While I really love the scent, I find that my skin is dried out.  My husband also had a reaction that has been confirmed after repeated washings.  This particular bar makes him itchy, while the cheap Suave that makes me itchy does not.  We normally use body soaps because it just feels hygenic and simpler to use in the shower for our family.  Our favoritie brands are Aveeno, St. Ives, Dove, Johnson & Johnson, Caress, Axe for men & Old Spice... none of these leave us itchy or dry.

While I ADORE the scent and size of the bar, I just can't get past the scratchies and slippery feeling.  Hubby can't get past the itchies.  Our family will have to pass.

"Pre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry",4.0,"I have another brand of bar soap with a much more potent patchouli fragrance.  I had hoped that I would be able to bury my nose in this bar from Pre de Provence and imagine that I had just opened a bottle of patchouli essential oil.  No, no, it did not happen.  While it is a lovely fragrance, it is somewhat meek and mild.  Maybe that is what you are looking for, but I wanted deep, true, powerful patchouli.

With this bar from Pre de Provence I do get rich, smoothing and soothing moisturizing.  It was opportune that I had recently purchased two bars of soap from Plantlife, patchouli and sandalwood.  Oh, my!  Those fragrances are potent and wonderful!  Way more so than those from Pre de Provence.  Having the two patchouli bars at the same time allowed me to see the moisturizing qualities of both soaps.  The Plantlife dried my skin.  This Pre de Provence always left my skin soft and supple.  It was a BIG difference; so easy to see when I had the two together.

So, when it comes to the patchouli and the sandalwood soaps, which one you would like better depends on what you are looking for in a soap:  True potent fragrance or moisturizing luxury.  For me it boils down to my skin's needs in the cooler, drier months, and that means I go with the Pre de Provence.

If you do want to try the Plantlife patchouli, this is it:&nbsp;Patchouli 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g).  Maybe you might be interested in an Italian bar soap put out by Pre de Provence.  It has a mix of patchouli and rosewood and bergamot:&nbsp;Via Mercato Italian Soap Bar (200g), No. 1 - Patchouli and Rosewood.  It has a lovely, intriguing and subtle fragrance.

A word on the size of this bar:  I have long fingers, so this large 250g size is not awkward in my hand.  But I can easily see that it might be a problem for smaller hands.  There is patchouli in the 200g size, but not the 150g.  Here is the link:&nbsp;Pre de Provence Shea Butter Enriched Artisanal French Soap Bar (200 g), Traditional Fragrance - Patchouli.",AT53ZTTO707MB,4.732456140350878,4.5,4.0
"Pre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry",4.0,"I love Pre de Provence bar soaps, and I love sandalwood.  By reading lots of reviews, I notice that many people do not like potent scents, and prefer light, delicate or unobtrusive fragrances.  I am not one of them.  I don't particularly like heavy, sweet and cloying scents, but I do love to breathe in intense, true fragrances.  (I say all this not to disrespect those who like unscented or light scents, but to let you know where my rating is coming from.)

I wanted to take a deep breath with my nose right up on this large bar of sandalwood and be able to say, ""Ahhh, sandalwood!""  No, that did not happen.  Yes, the sandalwood fragrance is there, but there are other scents as well, and together, it all gentles down the sandalwood.  It is a lovely soap, but not the sandalwood fragrance I was hoping for.

I have a bar of Plantlife Sandalwood soap that I bought about six weeks ago,&nbsp;Sandalwood 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g).  It has way more sandalwood fragrance than this Pre de Provence.  But, interestingly, I noticed something when I traded that bar for the Pre de Provence:  While the Plantlife has the fragrance, Pre de Provence has the moisturizers.  When using the Pre de Provence, I definitely noticed that my legs, feet, arms, hands were not dry.  As soon as I went back to the Plantlife--just one day--that soap dried out my skin.

So, depends on what you are looking for in your soap.  If you want the intense fragrance, choose Plantlife, and give up soft and smooth skin.  I found both to give great lather, but only the Pre de Provence gave moisture.

A word about the size of this 250g bar:  If you have long fingers or large hands, you will be able to grasp this bar easily.  If you have small hands, you might be better off with the 200g bar,Pre de Provence Shea Butter Enriched Artisanal French Soap Bar (200 g), Traditional Fragrance - Sandalwood, or the soap on a rope,&nbsp;Pre de Provence Soap On a Rope, Sandalwood, 200 Gram.

Unlike other brands, this manufacturers fragrance smells most like the actual herb and its subtle enough to be appreciated by both sexes.  I also like that these soaps include shea butter for a good lather.  Hands feel soft after drying too.  Theyre triple-milled, and if used solely for hand-washing, last a long time.  This is one of Pre de Provences bigger sized bars, so it lasts even longer.

This bar has a light, sweet smell of honey without overpowering like vanilla. The soap suds well and makes lots of foamy bubbles. But the best part is the almonds that get scratchy.

"Pre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry",5.0,"I love Pre de Provence soaps, but was intensely curious about the Sea Salt bar.  What would it smell like?  Why would I want to wash my hands with sea salt?  Happily, this PRE DE PROVENCE SEA SALT FRENCH SOAP BAR (150g, 5.2 Ounce) is no different from the other Pre de Provence soaps--it smells wonderful, and produces a rich, thick lather.

The fragrance is hard to describe.  Its kind of floral, but maybe is best described as fresh sea breeze.  It makes one think of fresh air and sunshine.  The fragrance doesn't linger overlong.  The soap doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, but may be a little more drying than other Pre de Provence soaps (unless it's my imagination working overtime).

The soap definitely contains salt. The ingredients are:  sodium palmate, sodium palm kernelate, water, fragrance, palm acid, titanium dioxide, glycerin, palm kernel acid, SODIUM CHLORIDE, shea butter, sodium hydroxide, tetrasodium edta, tetrasodium etidronate, benzyl salicylate, linalool, geraniol, citral.",A2MJ8OL2FYN7CW,4.732456140350878,5.0,4.0

"Pre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry",5.0,"If you love the scent of Patchouli plants and oils, you will love this soap!  This is a huge bar of soap.  It measures 4 inches wide and is 2.5 inches high and over an inch thick.  It is a light cocoa color with engravings on both sides of the bar.  The soap comes wrapped in plastic, but the aroma is unmistakably Patchouli.

To me, the scent the Patchouli reminds me of ""Dead Heads,"" or followers of the band Grateful Dead.  They made Patchouli oil main stream.  But Patchouli is also good to fight itchy skin, and smells wonderful. It has an unmistakable musky floral aroma.

This soap is also Shea Butter enriched, which means luxurious softness.  Nothing I've found blends into my skin like Shea Butter, and I have been religiously using Pre de Provence lotions with Shea Butter for a while now.  Their products are high quality and make me feel pampered.  The scents are delicious - I am feeding my soul with these wonderful fragrances.

While women will love this Patchouli Shea Butter Enriched soap, it will also be great for a man.  Patchouli is quite masculine.

This bar of soap is great for putting in your bathtub.  Or keep a bar at the sink to lather up and smell good between showers.  It makes a great gift - an addition to a gift basket for men or women.

"Pre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry",5.0,"This is an average-sized bar of scented French-milled, French-made soap designed to over a more luxurious experience than consumer-grade soaps. I will be comparing this both in use and in price to average body bars, but my rating takes into the account that this is a premium product which offers certain benefits that you cannot get from products like basic Ivory soap or Kirkland's body bar. This gets extra points for those added qualities.

I will note the price differences first. This is a 150-gram bar for a little under $5 whereas a 130-gram bar of Kirkland signature will cost you an average of 66 cents. Both bars will get you equally clean, but that is really the only point where the products overlap. Besides the truly lovely rose scent of this bar (it smells like a real rose  mild and not too overbearing, but present), it has a much better feel. The lather is creamier and feels silkier on the skin. One point about it that I was really happy about was that it wasn't so perfumey that I walked out of the shower smelling as if I'd applied a scent to my skin. This was more of an enjoyable transient experience in which I enjoyed the scent while I was using it, but didn't subject others to it once I was out of the bath. In my case, my husband is super sensitive to perfume-like smells so this worked for me. If you're looking for something longer lasting, this may not be what you're after.

In terms of how it leaves my skin, this is absolutely better for not drying my skin out. I'm guessing that this is the shea butter replenishing to some extent what oils the soap is stripping off when you use the soap. I wouldn't say that you don't need an added moisturizer after using it (at least I still needed moisturizer), but it's definitely gentler than other bars that I've used.

The bar is very hard or solid in a way that consumer-grade bars are not. This is because of the quad-milling that is advertised on the product page. I had not heard about this process before trying this soap, but it reduces the water content of the bars and makes them last longer. I will note that my average bar of soap will tend to melt in the shower and there are little stalactites of soap residue on my soap dish on my shower caddy where the soap has dissolved and the residue has drained off and hardened (which represents a loss of soap/value). This soap doesn't do that. It dries harder and firmer and doesn't melt away at the edges. That means that it lasts a lot longer. I can't do a scientific test or anything, but my best guess is that I got 3x the mileage out of this bar than the Kirkland bars that I usually use (and possibly 4x the use compared to Ivory, which I find melts away much more rapidly than any other soap). This is still a more expensive soap on average than consumer-grade brands, but it isn't quite as expensive as it seems when you factor in longevity and the quality of experience is rather markedly better in terms of the feel and the scent.",A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,4.732456140350878,5.0,4.0
"Pre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry",5.0,"Pr de Provence is known for the large blocks of savon de Marseille made with olive oil that are especially suited for use in the kitchen, but these newer artisanal bars are easier to handle.  They are made with vegetable oil only, no animal fat, and are quadruple-milled to last a long time.  They contain glycerin and shea butter as moisturizers, so that they don't dry out the skin as much as some soaps do.

The variety of fragrances is impressive, and they all smell so nice that its hard to decide on a favorite.  Agrumes (citrus) smells distinctly of grapefruit with lemony notes and the verbena smells as fresh as if you had just plucked a leaf from the bush and crushed it in your hand.  The almond, pomegranate, and mirabelle (plum) will make your mouth water.  The florals such as violette and angels trumpet are a pleasant change from  offensive artificial floral scents.  The milk, coconut, and green tea are more subdued fragrances and are a good choice for people who don't like strong fragrances.

Product description
Scent Name: Violate  |  Size:150 Gram
For centuries, the luxury of French-milled soaps has remained the gold standard of excellence. Each time you begin to lather a French made soap, you enter a time and place where quality and craftsmanship have stood still. Traditional French soap is triple-milled to produce a completely uniform and smooth soap, without impurities, thus lasting longer. Every bar of Pre de Provence soap is not only carefully made today by the dedicated soapmakers in Provence following their proud traditions, but quad-milled to be smoother and have a richer lather to create our luxurious feel. Using all pure, natural ingredients enriched with shea butter, you can feel the difference of our unique quad-milling process. Aromatic fragrances transport you to a moment of calmness, vitality, dreamin or well-being. This 150 Gram bar is a great value, the fragrance maintains until the soap is all used up. The soap creates a rich, creamy lather and rinses clean, leaving skin soft and hydrated.",A2BQWD54CXBX6R,4.732456140350878,5.0,4.0

A Dial bar lasts about a week at our house with two boys. This is harder and doesn't turn to mush.  I see that as a benefit just as it will last longer.

Better in that it will likely last almost twice as long.  Worse in that it is almost too big to hold (and probably is for people with small hands; I will not name names).  I guess I never put much thought into what Pomegranate smelled like, and now that I have taken a long strong whiff of it, I cannot say it is my favorite smell.

I received the ""agrumes"" scent, which is citrus in English, and I've used it for several days now.  It has a light scent of maybe citronella or lemon balm, which is very fresh and clean smelling.  The bar itself is huge (8.8 ounces) and rectangular, not like the rounded, concave, 3 ounce bar soaps we find at the store!  It lathers up quickly and produces a thick foamy lather that cleans well.  It also contains shea butter for moisturizing, although it rinses cleanly without any oily residue.

The bars are ""quad milled"" (processed four times) which makes them slow to dissolve, so one bar will last for several months with daily use.  I especially like that this soap doesn't contain parabens or sodium lauryl sulphate, both of which are linked to health issues.  I've made soap myself several times and know that soap doesn't have to have tons of chemicals to work well.

This is a nice bar of soap. It has a hard consistency, not a soft bar so it seems to last longer. The soap provides a lot of suds which makes you feel like you are getting clean. It is a large size too which my husband really loves.

I had never smelled starflower before. The scent of the soap is a floral but not in a heavy or sweet type scent, it smells nothing like roses or magnolias but is just clean floral scent. Im not a big fan of florals and this one is ok, my husband doesnt care for anything girly scented and he doesnt mind this one either.",ALNFHVS3SC4FV,4.732456140350878,5.0,4.0
"Pre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry",5.0,"French milled soap and glycerine soaps are a weakness of mine, especially is they are pretty and smell great. This is a great moisturizing formula.

My skin visually appears more moisturized when I use this  soap (compared to the brand that was previously in my shower). I still required lotion but could have skipped it without feeling dry and itchy.

 Linden smells like an ultra-mild lily-of-the-valley fragrance.  Peony smells... like a peony (assumption as I've never sniffed one before). I don't like the way that Angel's Trumpet smells.  It doesn't impact my rating... this just isn't the fragrance for me. I don't dislike it enough to let it go to waste so this isn't a deal breaker.

When using this soap the fragrance is stronger in the air than on my skin. It creates a relaxing experience without leaving the skin heavily perfumed.

The color of the soap is a bright green-yellow. More yellow. Peony is a soft blush/shell pink. Angel Trumpet is a yellow-beige that my kids describe as r sandy-yellow. There is a marbled like consistency to this barbiturates am overall smooth feel.  The bars have a 12/2019 expiration date on them.a

The soap does not get water-logged and squishy and that is a great indicator that the bar will last more than a week.

This formula is skin-friendly and I like that the fragrance is not overpowering. I can't wait to try other fragrances!",AKJHHD5VEH7VG,4.732456140350878,5.0,4.0

Well, this is a great bar of soap. It is heavy. At 250 grams, it is more than twice the weight of the Ivory soap that I have been using.  It is a pleasant pink color with dark red inclusions, presumably the pomegranate.

Using the soap for showering, I have found that the surface has a texture created by the pomegranate specks. This makes it easier to grip. Also, I like the way that it feels on my skin.  It has a light refreshing fragrance. The soap itself cleans well, does not leave a residue, and does not dry out my skin. I really like using it.",A3FKGKUCI3DG9U,4.732456140350878,5.0,4.0

I kind of expected this bar to be drying to the skin (as in many mass produced soaps), but found it left my skin soft - nearly as soft as my own handmade soaps (I add a LOT of exta superfat).  I use plentiful amounts of Shea butter in my soaps and have found it to be a wonderful ingredient.  It certainly makes the Pre de Provence bar richer.  The honey/almond scent is delightful and I may try to find a similar fragrance oil for my own soaps.  The bar is very big and should last a long time.  If you don't have a source of artisan soaps and still use the likes of Ivory or any deodorant bar STOP using them and purchase a real bar of soap like the Pre de Provence.  It contains all the natural glycerin that many other manufacturers take out.  Glycerin content is really what makes for a good, moisturizing soap.",A2VH0UT5EQFB6P,4.732456140350878,4.0,4.0
"Pre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry",5.0,"This is a GIANT bar of dense soap.  Much more than a handful and quite heavy.  The pomegranate version I received smells absolutely wonderful, even through the cellophane packaging.  The speckled pink color and imprinted Pre de Provence logo also makes for a very attractive presentation on the sink or in the bath.  Obviously, all of this makes one anxious to finally bathe with it - and it doesn't disappoint.

A smooth creamy feel.  Those little speckles are hard particles that will provide a stimulating scrubbing and exfoliating action against the skin.  Mild lather.  It does burn if you get it in your eyes.  As expected, the smell is pleasant and bold and makes bathing a treat.  Rinsing seems to take more than average effort, as this soap is rich and tends to want to hang around.  After toweling my skin was literally squeaky clean, if you can appreciate that analogy.  An hour after drying . . . skin (including my face) was no longer ""squeaky"", but clearly felt moisturized and soft.  The scent lingered mildly, not so much pomegranate, but rather a clean soapy scent.

This is a fine, luxurious soap.  The experience with it is much different than using even the better regarded mainstream American store shelf soaps.  After a couple of uses, I've hardly diminished the huge soap bar, I expect it will last weeks.  Considering the long bar life, maybe this soap is not all that expensive - making it a comparatively inexpensive little personal luxury.  A nice discovery.",AW7BIYHXUIZ62,4.732456140350878,5.0,4.0

Pre de Provence Shea Butter Enriched Artisinal soap is fancy soap that doesn't cost a  lot of money.  It comes wrapped in a clear cellophane wrapper, which is more than most atisan soaps have.  Many Artisan soaps come without any packaging.

My bar of soap weighs just under 6 ounces.  It's over an inch thick and 3.5 inches long.  Good sized bar of soap.  Mine is mint green with brown flecks.  I am reminded of mint chocolate chip ice cream. It's Rosemary mint.  I love mint soaps, shampoos, and lotions.  The mint is a great eye opener and invigorates tired bones.

"Pre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry",5.0,"This review is for the green tea scented shea butter soap.

This soap is a nice thick bar that's easy to hold.  It arrived a bit soft, as if it didn't have a long cure, but that could be from a higher shea butter content, as really high content shea butter tends to be soft like that. In any event, I didn't feel like sitting it around to attempt to dry it out further, I wanted to use it!  (So I did!)  It smells of green tea but it is not a very strong scent.  It's attractive, olive green and has the Pre de Provence logo etched into the bar.  It came plainly wrapped in cellophane.

It lathers very well.  If you work it, it develops into a creamy foam - another reason I suspect the shea butter content is high.  It leaves skin very clean and with a green tea scent that clings lightly- for hours if I'm not that active.  My husband and son also like it.

The green tea scent is like the smell I'd experience smelling a cup of brewed green tea, it is NOT as sharp as the famous perfume by that name, and it is much more subtle, and natural smelling than that.

This is a soap that you need to allow to dry well after use, because it is soft, and it will degrade if left in a wet area for too long.",A2R1HUYHXV7H18,4.732456140350878,5.0,4.0

I've been a fan for years.  Pre de Provence has greatly expanded their line over the past few years, and more and more of them are showing up on Amazon.  To have such wonderful French products available here at the touch of my computer screen is a real treat!
This line of soaps with Shea butter is especially comforting and gratifying.  I tried the lavender fragrance in this line and it is very fragrant.  It is floral and spicy and not cloyingly sweet.  It is a sophisticated fragrance, and it is potent and true lavender.  Just lovely!

The shea butter in this bar seems to make the lather glide smoothly across my skin.  It washes off well, yet seems to leave a softness behind that clings to my skin.  The little brownish pieces in the bar are actually pieces of petal.  I does not add any coarseness to the bar, and I think it may be included just to add to the ""artisanal"" look.  But maybe it works to hold essential oil, too.
The fragrance lasts only for an hour or two, and that is as it should be, I think.  It does not interfere with the perfume I wear.  The lavender fragrance is mostly restricted to the bath.",AT53ZTTO707MB,4.732456140350878,4.5,4.0

"Pre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry",4.0,"Pre de Provence offers some very good soaps with excellent fragrances, including this one - white gardenia.

The pluses are they are large and last a long time due to being milled (compressed) and the air bubbles take out rendering a very solid soap with heft. They have great smell and the aroma really matches a natural gardenia. They lather very well. All in all, they are very well made.

Now the small minus(es). These soaps contain small amounts of Tetrasodium EDTA & Tetrasodium Etidronate (as listed), which I developed an allergy to over the years and a small percentage of the population is like me. Therefore, if you are allergic to these chemicals, you should think twice or use modestly.",AF5AJ5V9T6LTS,4.732456140350878,3.6666666666666665,4.0

The result is a soap without air pockets and thus lasts longer and lathers better. This soap line has excellent natural scent, which is not overpowering. One bar lasts a very long time. This is also free of parabens, ethyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, and DEA.

That said, the Milk Soap is a little strange. It smells like baby powder -- our whole bathroom smells like baby powder now, actually. Maybe it's just us... The soap does leave our skin very clean, it feels a bit smoother against the skin than other Pre de Provence varieties. We'll use it until the bar is gone, but I will likely never buy it again.

It still gets 5 stars though. It works great, softens our skin and the smell does feel very clean. It's just a personal dislike of the scent; my partner doesn't mind it and wouldn't complain if we purchased more milk soap.",A2ACUGNVT36JYX,4.732456140350878,5.0,4.0

I'll never order soap from another company, Pre de Provence gets everything correct. The bar size is great and the soap lasted my husband and I about six months!

It takes days to wash out as well. I heard many good things about this oil but this oil left my curls dry, and created more knots in my hair which lead to more breakage.

"Hydrating Rose Water Facial Toner. Adjusts The pH Of Your Skin While Removing Remaining Oils, Dirt And Dead Skin Cells. Moroccan Rose Water Toner For Skin Leaves Your Skin Smooth And Silky Soft. 4 OZ",5.0,"I received a discounted price to provide an honest and unbiased review.

This rose water facial toner is rather simple and as it is. Upon waking up from a nap, I suddenly had an urge to try the rose water that came in on the same day even though I was planning for another day.

There are total of 6 ingredients on the list;
- Aloe
- Rose (distilated)
- Glycerin
- Phenoxyethanol
- Tetrasodium EDTA

The toner is transparent in color just like water and smells like parfum. It does smell like rose however but not the way roses actually smell, therefore I think that they have added some sort of fragrance, etc. Not listed however.

As for my experience with the toner, I applied it on my face with the help of a piece of cotton which was on the directions. The toner felt very cool and refreshing on my face. I am rather neutral about the scent because it is not too strong if you apply just a little bit on your face with a piece of cotton or tissue is fine. It is very hot today, hitting almost 90 degrees ;<
There was no irritation or discomfort on my skin therefore I feel safe. I do have sensitive skin and I feel that this is a good facial toner for people with sensitive skin.
As for a moisturizer I did not feel the necessity to use one after using the toner. I feel that the toner is fine alone.",A2T0A3DUB6M3O2,4.5,5.0,4.0
"Hydrating Rose Water Facial Toner. Adjusts The pH Of Your Skin While Removing Remaining Oils, Dirt And Dead Skin Cells. Moroccan Rose Water Toner For Skin Leaves Your Skin Smooth And Silky Soft. 4 OZ",4.0,"I received this product testing and reviewing purposes.
When I received this product, I was hoping to see 100% rosewater only instead, it had different ingredients which are still safe to use on the skin but since I'm a regular rose water fan and use the 100%  percent Morrocan Rose Water ingredient which is Rosa Damascena, I was hesitant to try it because of all the other ingredients it contained.

I sprayed some on a cotton pad and pat it on my face and was able to lift some makeup residue and not break out or have any skin irritations. The scent is very beautiful and not too strong and I actually spritzed some on my hair for some fly always.
But I have to say the Elrique Naturals does the same thing at toning and hydrating and refreshing the skin like my other rose water bottles.
Overall this rose water is nice but I'm still confused why couldn't they just leave it pure. But at least it does work!",A3QKWFC92S03MP,4.5,4.0,4.0

"Emu Oil Pure HUGE 4 OZ VALUE SIZE! Pure Emu Oil For Hair Growth, Hair Conditioner And Hair Health - Emu Oil Hydrates The Skin And Is A Great Skin Moisturizer On Its Own.",5.0,"I received a discounted price for the oil to review. My review of the oil is 100% honest and my own.

I did a little research before I tested the emu oil. Here is a little background of the Emu bird;
They are native to Australia and they can grow to a large size - 6 feet in height. They cannot fly or walk backwards.
I have to admit that I feel bad using the oil after knowing what an Emu farm is. Raised and killed for their oil/meat. However this will not affect my review and rating for the oil.

The emu oil is not just for the hair and skin as moisturizer but it can be used to treat many chronic skin ailments;

- Rashes
- pain (muscle pain, back pain, legs, etc)
- sore feet
- blisters
- bug bites
- acne (due to anti-inflammatory properties)

The oil seem to be semi-transparent in color. It is a little cloudy with bubble like tissues? Perhaps is particles of fat? See picture 2 and 3.
The scent is extremely faint and you can hardly notice any. Nothing unpleasant.
The oil is non greasy and non oily. Very gently oil actually, almost like argan oil.
I applied just a dab bit on my hand and rubbed in a circular motion. It felt cool and moisturizing. No irritation or discomfort and no side-effect.
After about 3 minutes of drying, my skin felt very soft.

I feel that it is a waste to use it in hair because emu oil is very precious and quite expensive. I will use this for skin only; muscle pain, rashes, sores, etc.",A2T0A3DUB6M3O2,5.0,5.0,4.0

The other one I had was white in color and it was not oil at all, well that being said I love the way this oil feels on my skin. I have use it on my hands and it feels soft and moisturized.
It hydrates very well. I am using it on a scar to see if it will diminish as of now it has not but it was a pretty deep wound so I am going to see if it heals more in the inside and just keep putting some of this.
The consistency is just right and it is like a yellowish color.
This suppose to help to diminish scars,stretch marks,and fine lines as well as moisturizes dry, flaky and tired skin.
With this product you can also use it to nourish dry and damage hair if you like.

100% Pure Organic Rosehip Oil HUGE 4 OZ VALUE SIZE! Rosehip Seed Oil For Face And Skin Potent Skin And Hair Health Elixir - Best Hydrating Organic Rosehip Seed Oil For Face And Skin,4.0,"I've been rendered really surprised by the effectiveness of this product. I've heard of Rosehip Oil before but I've never tried it before. After about two weeks of use (especially during this harsh cold weather) I'm a believer in it's moisturizing benefits. Since it's a large bottle, I've been using it on damp skin immediately after getting out of the shower. It not only locks in moisture but it penetrates the skin and dries quickly and leaves no trace. I haven't messed up any clothes doing this. Additionally, this method works very well for my hair as well. When it's used on damp hair, the oil leaves hair shiny, soft and moisturized without any greasy residue. I want to try it on  my face because Miranda Kerr, The Duchess of Cambridge, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Victoria Beckham all swear by it as an overnight treatment. However, since I have oily skin, I'll have to try it on a small bit of skin and see how that goes.

FACTS:
-Scientifically called Rosa Aff Rubiginosa or Rosa Moschata. Typically cold-press extraction methods are used to separates the oil from the hips and seeds.
-Contains essential
* Essential Fatty Acids: Highly regarded for reducing scars and promoting skin regeneration. These emollients also improve skin elasticity,tone, texture and pigmentation
*Vitamin E: Known to speed up healing, repairs and reduces scarring.
*Vitamin C : Antioxidant that stimulates collagen production (essential to youthful appearance)
*B-carotene(a form of vitamin A): Helps oil penetrate the skin. This element also improves the moisture levels as well as reduces wrinkles and fine lines.

PROS:

-4oz pump (you get allot of use out of this size and the pump prevents contamination from fingers)
-the entire bottle comes sealed for consumer protection
-can be used for beauty benefits for hair, face and body

CAUTION:
-Can induce allergic reaction for people with sensitive skin.
-Acne prone may also react to the oil despite it being Organic. That goes for those with Oily skin as well. A test patch is highly recommended by dermatologists.

100% Pure Organic Rosehip Oil HUGE 4 OZ VALUE SIZE! Rosehip Seed Oil For Face And Skin Potent Skin And Hair Health Elixir - Best Hydrating Organic Rosehip Seed Oil For Face And Skin,5.0,"at first i saw this and of course kind of made a face, every ones doing the rose hip seed oil but which quality is the better of them all was my question and why, which one was raw in its form and which one had this distinct smell of roses held to long, You see real rose hip seed oil has this almost mildew smell, other companies distill there's so the smell is actually gone, and over filter it, i have noticed two things when you do this.

1. it removes some of the actual properties used for healing hair and skin
2. it does change the original colour and scent

However this does not mean that it does not work, it does just not at the highest you would expect, it would take a lot more to do a little bit than less to do more which is what we are looking for. with that said Elrique Naturals has figured it out again.

Pros:
Healing properties are explained as healing skin and face blemishes, great for a skin cleanser for those with psoriasis like myself, excema, as well as blemishes to the skin from acne.

haircare when used on wet hair it gives a glossy sheen to it, remember a little goes a long way.

After shower treatment to keep your skin looking and feeling healthy all day.

great to mix in shea butter for a lip treatment or balm for every day use specially in the winter.

conditioning treatment added with an array of other oils (coconut, shea, jojoba, castor) can make this oil the perfect oil for treating dry and brittle ends or just to liven up your hair with a co wash before your shower, leave it on for at least an hour before you shampoo out.

Plastic brown bottle makes it easier to store and keep in a dark place, i wouldn't suggest a fridge since it will make the oil thicken but if your not worried about that go ahead and do that since it will only prolong the life of your oil.

easy dispense push down top, this top is a good idea, i would have liked one that you could close that a child wouldn't be able to squirt it all over the place, but since i do not have small children in my home, I do not have to worry about such things, i would suggest not keeping this at a level to where a child could eat it as roses in any form are good for the skin not internal organs.

Cons:

the distinct smell may be a huge turn off for some, but remember real organics do have strange smells so please don't let that be a turn off to great benefits. remember as they say nothing good  for you actually smells or tastes good

I THINK THE LITTLE BIT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SERUMS IS THAT RHIS ONE HAS COQ10. I HAVENT SEEN THAT UNGREDIENT IN OTHER VITAMIN C SERUMS THAT I HAVE TRIED.

IVE BEEN SEEING LOTS OF ARTICLES AND POSTS ON VITAMIN C SERUMS AND CREAMS IN MAGAZINE ARTICLES, ON LINE, ON TELEVISION, AND ON BLOGS, SO I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY AND IM ABSOLUTELY AMAZED WITH THE RESULTS THAT I GOT!

AT THIS POINT IVE TRIED 6 DIFFERENT TOPICAL VITAMIN C'S, THIS BEING MY SIXTH, VITAMIN C PRODUCT, AND FOURTH THAT IS A SERUM AND NOT A CREAM.

I HAVE A REALLY BIG BELLY BUTTON SCAR FROM MY TUBLIGATION, AND THIS IS THE THIRD SERUM THAT I TRIED ON IT. I AM ON DAY 9 OF USING THIS VITAMIN C PRODUCT,. THIS IS WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH THE PREVIOUS VITAMIN C SERUMS AND WILL DO WITH THIS ONE TOO AS I AM ALREADY NOTICING A CHANGE ON DAY 3. FIRST, I STARTED OFF USING THE SERUM ONLY ONCE A DAY TO SEE IF I ACTUALLY SEE RESULTS, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT AGREES WITH MY SKIN AS WELL. AFTER 3 DAYS OF USING IT MY SCAR HAD NOTICABLY LIGHTENED UP AND I HAD NO TROUBLE USING IT, SO I INCREASED MY DAILY USAGE UP TO TWO TIMES A DAY, I WOULD APPLY IT IN THE MORNING BEFORE GETTING DRESSED AND AGAIN AT NIGHT BEFORE BED. I HAVE 5 CHILDREN, SO I DO NOT HAVE A SET SHOWERING SCHEDULE, I THROW ONE IN WHEN I CAN, SO OBVIOUSLY WEATHER IT WAS MORNING OR NIGHT I APPLIED THE VITAMIN C AFTER MY SHOWER.

THIS ELRIQUE NATURALS VITAMIN C SERUM IS A CLEARISH LIKE IN COLOR SERUM AND HAS A THICKER SERUM TEXTURE. I LOVE THAT IT IS NOT COMPLETELY THIN LIKE WATER. I DO WISH IT WERE A HAIR BIT THICKER, BUT THE PRODUCT IS AWESOME AND DOESNT DESERVE A LOWER RATING BECAUSE OF IT.

I don't use blush and couldn't tell you how it works as a blush brush.  Was a little worried that it would be flimsy or harsh considering the price, but it turned out to be an excellent kabuki brush...  so gentle and soft.  The bristles are fine and do a much better job at blending fountain than  my old set.  Plus I can tuck this away in my purse and touch up or reapply on the go without making a mess.

"Briogeo - Rosarco Milk Reparative Leave-In Conditioning Spray, Ultra-Lightweight Leave-In Conditioner for Those with Dry, Damaged, and Brittle Hair, 5 oz",4.0,"I've been using this at night for a little over a week now.  I am mostly happy with it, but I don't think it is going to be a ""must buy"" product for me, because there are other leave-ins that I like just a little more (It's a 10 is my favorite).  But, due to ingredients, this could be an option for you, and it is a good product.  (More on ingredients below.)

I have waist-length, color-treated hair.  I shampoo it every day (I work out and sweat a lot so I pretty much have to).  So it gets a little dry.  I use a bit of hair oil on the roots and then I spray this throughout the length.  I use it on semi-damp, partially towel-dried hair after showering.  I comb it through with a detangling brush and I do have to say, this is an excellent detangler.

The next morning, my hair is soft and shiny.  Maybe the ends are not perfect, but the majority of the length of the hair looks lovely.  I am docking a star, though, because this just does not take care of frizz for me.  We recently had a super rainy weekend and, even though I was using this, I had poofy hair with frizz, so I had to use additional hair oil the next day to take care of that.

This is lightweight.  I was just guessing as to how much to use and sometimes the guessing goes wrong for me with products like this.  However, I never managed to put too much of this in my hair and my hair was never weighed down, never looked greasy or dirty.  I was using somewhere between 5 and 8 sprays on my hair, I think.  I did not get product buildup over time, either, which is great.

I don't notice much of a scent although this does have some fragrance ingredients (no artificial dyes, though).  It seems, based on my experience, safe to use every day.  Here is the ingredients list since I didn't see it on the product page:

Water, Coconut Oil, Argan Kernel Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Shea Butter, Hibiscus Flower Extract, C20-22 Alcohols*, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Esters, Orange Peel Oil, Grapefruit Peel Oil, Lemon Peel Oil, Tangerine Peel Oil, Sandalwood Oil, Glycerin, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 60, Polysorbate 80, Fragrance, Aminomethyl Propanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.

This is a vegan product, if that is of concern to you.

Overall, this did have a lot of good properties and I will definitely finish my bottle.  I just need something that deals with frizz a little more for my next purchase.  If frizz is not a problem for you, or if you want a bit of additional volume along the length of your hair, in addition to the detangling and shine/softness benefits, this may work for you.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,4.0,4.0,4.0
Foundation Primer - Face Primer Fills In Creases And Fine Lines For Flawless Coverage For Makeup - No Greasy Feel - Fragrance Free - 100% Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee,5.0,"When it comes to primer, I've tried a ton of different brands, from high end to drugstore brands, but I always goes back to the same one. I'm very particular about primer, especially when it comes to how it feels on my face and the texture of it.  I was interested to try this, but it was going to take a lot to really impress me.

One thing that will turn me off from a primer immediately is the smell.  I don't like my primers to have a strong smell or anything like that, and right away I was pleased with the way this smells. I really liked the texture of this. I've found that most primers that work really well tend to have this texture, it's definitely thicker than a lotion and isn't runny at all.

Obviously the true test is how well does your makeup hold up??? Well, I worked a 10 hour shift and my face makeup still looked amazing, which is saying a lot during the summer! In fact, I kind of hope they make an eyelid primer, because as you can see in the picture my eye makeup did NOT hold up as well as my face makeup did!

My favorite primer happens to be a high end primer that generally tends to ""smash"" the competition, but I would say this primer is on par with that primer, and I love the addition of the vitamin E!

This is the perfect product to put on your high heels if you are in a park for a wedding , birthday or even at a church function outside.

They work very well and they don't let your heels get messed up, the big round bottom don't let your heels dig in the dirt which is great because you won't go out of balance.

I love that it came in a nice little mesh pouch and you can put them in your purse or in your car so when that time comes you are prepared.

This is a also a great gift for all the bridesmaid if your wedding is taking place outside. The mesh pouch comes with a nice ribbon for a gift.

They come 4 in a pack which I like but I gave it a four because they come in small sizes so they won't fit all of my stiletto heels.
Overall I am liking them because they are a great protection on the heels that they fit.

"Insane Deal! Powerful 3 in 1 Professional Blue Electric Callus Remover, Epilator &amp; Shaver Rechargeable Cordless Gentle and Safe for Healthy and Smooth Skin for Women or Men.",4.0,"This combo callus remover/epilator/shaver has several things going for it:  I love that it is lighted, and that the light is nice and bright and angled properly so that I can see tiny hairs and see what I'm doing.  It has a great ergonomic grip and it feels good in the hand.  Best of all, it is rechargeable and that means that it is more powerful than similar hand-helds that use AA batteries.  It charges over night and gets one through over 30 minutes of use without starting to squeal in defeat.

That being said:  The three different heads are smaller than other similar hand-helds that I own......The roller head on the callus remover is not wide enough and the roller is also a smaller diameter (means that the roller revolves faster per second; but that does not mean it works better or more efficiently).  There is only one roller head for the callus remover, and it has a fine-grade grit.  Fine-grade is adequate for touch-up work, but if one does not buff their feet often, fine-grade grit is not enough to remove tough calluses.  A half-hour working time for the battery will not remove tough calluses.  You will need to recharge and give it another go the next day, and the next day, and the next.....Of course, one can leave the appliance plugged into the adapter and a wall outlet.  In that case, you can continue on, but it will take you a long time to wear down a tough, thick callus with this fine-grade grit roller.  The kit should really contain a coarse-grade grit roller, in addition.

New roller heads are NOT available for sale at this time, although the seller assures me that they are soon to be added.  Also, the heads on this appliance have a bit of a bough, or curve, on one side, so they are not interchangeable with other makes and models.

The epilator works decently.  Like I already said the head is narrower than most, so it does take at least quadruple the time to remove hair from one leg, as opposed to shaving. It removes most hairs, but misses a lot of fine hairs.

The razor works okay, but it does not cut real close to the skin.  It does leave a slight stubble.

Thinking through all the pros and cons, I would like to say that my four-star rating is a low one--maybe 3.5, if Amazon offered it.

"Insane Deal! Powerful 3 in 1 Professional Blue Electric Callus Remover, Epilator &amp; Shaver Rechargeable Cordless Gentle and Safe for Healthy and Smooth Skin for Women or Men.",5.0,"I really liked the idea of this product - three tools in one.  I wasn't sure it would be good at each of the three functions, but in the end, it was much better than I expected it to be.  And I will definitely be getting a lot of use out of it!

I tried the epilator in my bikini area.  It did hurt, but I would expect that when hairs are getting pulled out by the root.  It did best on hairs that were 1/4 inch or longer.  (I have an Emjoi epilator that works about the same.)  It is not quite as wide as my other epilator, but the narrowness is perhaps quite well suited to use under the arms.  As an epilator, it did an excellent job.

I used the shaver part under my arms.  Although the manual recommends doing this after you shower, I did it before, when there was still deodorant residue under my arms, and I still got a very close shave.  I do not have any other shavers to compare to as I typically use a manual razor for this.  But I was definitely happy with the performance, even on the uneven surface of my underarm.

And I used the callus remover on the sides and bottom of my heels.  I did this when they were dry and you could see as the outer layer of dead skin cells just came off.  My feet were a little softer right as soon as I used this, but it's going to take a few weeks of regular use for best results.  It didn't hurt at all.

This is rechargeable.  I like not being tethered to the wall for certain activities (for example, it would be difficult to use this on the feet while plugged in).  To first charge it, I just left it plugged in overnight.  I am not sure how long it actually took to charge, because the red ""charging"" light never went off.  However, when I unplugged it to use, it stayed on the whole time.  (I would estimate I ran it for about 10 minutes, total, the first time I tried it.)  So it defnitely holds a charge long enough to get the job done.

This does have a little light on it that can help guide you, if you are so inclined to use it.  (It's on whenever the unit is on.)  This only has one button/switch, so it's easy to operate.  It's also quite easy to change out the various heads.  It's a bit difficult to clean, especially the epilator part (it comes with a little brush that may help) but my other epilator has similar problems due to the nature of how all epilators work.

Note: after epilating, it's a good idea to use something like pfb Vanish (a roll-on product designed to prevent ingrown hairs).  You don't have to choose that brand; there are others that do essentially the same thing.

I do wish this came with a storage case or pouch (I guess you can put it back in the box?).  But other than that, this device exceeded my expectations and should be especially handy for travel (i.e., no lugging 2 or 3 separate devices around).

"Insane Deal! Powerful 3 in 1 Professional Blue Electric Callus Remover, Epilator &amp; Shaver Rechargeable Cordless Gentle and Safe for Healthy and Smooth Skin for Women or Men.",4.0,"I was offered this product for free. The following is my unbiased review after testing it carefully.

This is a rechargeable unit that can be used without the cord. I find that a bonus as these units eat batteries. On a full charge, this lasted for forty minutes during testing before I noticed a decrease in power. Pack the cord if you travel with it. I did not test standby time.

The callus remover does it's job well. Be sure to apply only gentle pressure, this is sanding off skin. If you use it against healthy skin, you could cause a mild abrasion. I always rinse the sanding wheel after use and allow it to drip dry after blotting off the water. This removes the skin flakes. Obviously, do not use this if you have an infection of any type on your feet or have any problem that causes numbness in your feet. This will slow down if you press too hard, but use your brain, gentle pressure and short sessions. Putting on socks after you slather on lotion can help keep the calluses at bay long term after using this.

The shaver head is perfect for either trimming or shaving. Not quite baby smooth, but very close. It took as much time as a manual razor but no risk of slicing myself. (Real danger for me, I usually press too firmly with the regular razor and have shaved off narrow patches of skin.)

The epilator is a small head. The petite size makes it ideal for small patches, not so great for legs. It is appropriate for under arms, forearms, etc.. The feeling is more intense than waxing. Waxing is a long strip, this is a tiny swath at a time, a few hairs at a time. If you have a low pain tolerance, skip using this head and use the trimmer instead. I like the smoothness left behind, but disliked the time it took. Waxing takes fifteen minutes for both legs. This took twenty minutes for one. The pulling feeling as hair is yanked takes getting used to at first. Try a small spot first on the leg that is less sensitive. Stay on the side or back of your leg at first as this is a less sensitive spot than the fronts of the leg.

Do use common sense, this is not to be used in the tub or near water.

The directions are easily understood and the callus remover + is packaged neatly in an attractive package designed for retail.",A1MF83RMFXN6TF,4.333333333333333,4.0,4.0

Fan Makeup Brush - Powder Concealer Foundation Blush Blending Highlight Bronzer Contour Makeup Brush - with Premium Soft Synthetic Hair,5.0,"This is THE best contour brush!!
- It's thick/dense - the bristles are tightly packed so it applies contour powder/foundation right where you want it
- Super soft - the synthetic bristles are really soft, making this brush feel wonderful against your skin.
- It works well!!  I had previously been using an eyeshadow brush to apply contour before trying this brush and I am really glad to have this one now because it is so much quicker and a more even distribution of product before buffing out.  It works well because you can use this to apply contour thick to then buff out with a kabuki brush or you can use this same brush and just apply a little contour and there is no need to buff it out after because this provides such a great even soft distribution if you want it to.

Overall I LOVE this brush and definitely recommend it.  It's an awesome price and so worth it.

"Scuddles - Blackhead extractor kit face Cleanser treatment, 7 Professional Tools For Blemish Pimple Popping Zit, Acne Nose Charcoal Mask Peel Off Mask (Blakhead Remover)",5.0,"This kit is AMAZING!!  I couldn't be more happy with this kit.  Okay maybe if the lancet was a little sharper that would be nice, but overall this is an amazing blackhead remover kit.  Before getting this kit I had one little black head remover tool that I rarely used because I rarely felt like it was the right tool for the job.  But now I feel like there is a tool for every and any kind of blackhead, whitehead, blemish I could get.  I love this kit!!

PROS
' Comes with 5 tools, so 10 different heads you could possibly use for any individual thing that needs popping/squeezing.
' Comes with a great set of directions from the seller - so if you purchase this check your email because the seller sent me the instructions and directions after purchasing it.

CONS:
' Lancet part could be sharper, but then again it's probably good that I'm not able to cut deep with it because I don't want to scar my face while using this.

Brief summary of the helpful descriptions that come (via email) about of the different types of extractors that come in the kit.
Spoon shaped extractor (hole in the middle) its over the blackhead. As gentle pressure is applied to the area, the trapped oil/blackhead pushes out and is released from the skin.
The lancet (needle shaped) end can be used to puncture whiteheads (if it's sharp) - which is good to release the oil/bacteria.
Thin angled curette (looped shape) extractor is used to roll out mature white heads and the flat side to press out blackheads.
Curve angled curette (loop shape) extractor has a unique shape for hard to reach places.
Angled curette extractors come in different shapes and sizes for those delicate areas of the face or body.

Overall I LOVE this kit and am very pleased with the quality of the extractor and how easily they have made it to extract blemishes/blackheads from my skin.

"Massage Oil Body Oil Fractionated Coconut Oil For Aromatherapy Relaxing Oil Massage - Pure &amp; Natural Carrier Massaging Oils, Hair &amp; Skin Care Benefits, Moisturizer &amp; Softener - 10.2 fl Oz",5.0,"Ylang Ylang Oil is one of my favorite oils scent wise because of the floral-y smell so trying this Ylang Ylang Oil By Pure Body Naturals was definitely an excitement to me! Pure Body Naturals has indeed made a high quality Ylang Ylang oil that smells just as floral-y as any other brand of ylang ylang oil I've tried. I love using this Ylang Ylang oil in my oil diffuser and letting it fill up my house with that amazing relaxing scent. I have some artificial flowers so I wanted to see if I could put a little bit of the Ylang Ylang oil on them to make them have the floral scent so whenever I'm around them I can smell them and feel like I have real flowers next to me. I put a couple drops on a cotton ball and ran it over the artificial flowers and surprisingly it worked!

This Ylang Ylang Oil comes in a 4oz bottle which will last for a long time for me personally anyways. It also comes with a glass dropper so you can get the right amount of oil without wasting it. I would definitely recommend this Ylang Ylang Oil By Pure Body Naturals!

LOL -- don't like to admit it but sometimes having to get them waxed every week can be a total pain (literally), but these tweezers work amazing!!! WOW!!!  The slant allows great accuracy to getting that one hair -- and you don't need to hope and pray that you grabbed it you pull back.  It grips!  The size of these tweezers are also very comfortable.

I have several other mosquito bracelets that also work but they are not anywhere as strong as these are. It's also a plus that ya just slip it on over your wrists and ankles if they're really bad and voila your a human mosquito repeller. I only hope that these work as well in the summer months because Florida is a hotbed for mosquitos and being right on the coast there isn't a whole lot of time out of the year that we are mosquito free.

It's been extra humid so these blood suckers are out in full force, but now -- I am not drenching my body in spray on repellent.  This bracelet comes well packaged.  When you open it, it will have a strong smell, but then, it's got repellent on it, if it didn't smell somewhat, I'd be worried.  Slapped the bracelet right on, and went outside for a bbq, and NOT ONE mosquito bite!  Woohoo!!!!  If it didn't start raining I think I could've slept outside!

Miracle Marvel 10 Effects - 10 In 1 Keratin Based Miracle Leave-In Hair Treatment - 8.45oz/250ml,5.0,"I've got fine, curly hair that tends to look flat and greasy if I use a regular conditioner.  I usually just apply a drop or two of argan oil or anti-frizz serum to keep my curls defined, but I've had to pick between dry curls or a ""bad hair day"" after I broke down and conditioned it.

I've been using Marvel 10 Effects leave-in conditioner for a couple of weeks now, and I'm in love!  It gives just a small touch of conditioning to my hair - making it shiny, static free, and helping define my curls - without weighing it down.  I spray it on my towel dried hair after shampooing, brush it through, scrunch my hair and let it air dry.  I don't normally use a blow dryer or heat styling tools, but for those that do, this product will protect against heat damage.  My daughter (who has very thick, very long, coarse hair) used it before she straightened her hair, and it left her hair silky and shiny.

Our hair is naturally made up of keratin, but it can be stripped out by bleaching, coloring, perming or straightening.  As we age our hair dulls as keratin production slows.  This product is a good alternative to expensive salon keratin treatments, as it absorbs into the hair strands and helps revive the beauty of our hair.",AEC90GPFKLAAW,5.0,5.0,4.0
Miracle Marvel 10 Effects - 10 In 1 Keratin Based Miracle Leave-In Hair Treatment - 8.45oz/250ml,5.0,"Having Marvel 10 Effects 10 in 1 Hair Treatment in your collection of hair treatment products is like getting to amplify by ten times the magnificence you normally expect from the appearance of your hair! I couldn't believe the great way this product REALLY works!  The difference between this and regular hair treatments is distinct and unique. It is wonderful!
I gave Marvel 10 Effects the real litmus test: I shampooed my hair with a fairly nondescript, somewhat drying shampoo, Then I used no conditioner, and towel dried my hair. I followed the directions and sprayed Marvel 10 Effects directly on my damp hair. Then I used a brush (!!!). It went through beautifully, as if I had all sorts of detangling, conditioning products in my hair. Then I blew my hair dry, a bit more roughly than usual, to see what would happen. I did cool the dryer down at the end to seal my hair. However it was a vigorous drying session!
I then looked at my hair and could not believe the difference in the glossiness, the texture, the appearance of volume, and the fullness. With no frizzy ends, and even an appearance of shape and volume, as if I had used hair spray ( but without any of the tacky texture you get with hair spray)!  This is an awesome product.

On the bottle, it says that the ten benefits you get from Marvel 10 Effects are:
1) Replenishes lost moisture in dry, damaged hair (<--it did)
2) Prevents static (<--it does ... and I have been known to be the ""queen of static""!)
3) Protection from heated styling tools (<--that is why I blew my hair dry using high heat, and although I do not recommend doing that, Marvel 10 came through for me as stated. I did it as a test, and it passed it completely)
4) Effective detangler (<--Yes! As I said! )
5) Rich in antioxidants (<--what are antioxidants? They keep your hair healthy...Healthy is how my hair feels, now!)
6) Aids in brushing to help reduce breakages (<--from the time my hair has been treated with this product, every time I have brushed it since, it looks great)
7) Maintains hair styles for longer (<--Yes indeed! It is amazing!)
8) Reduces the appearance of split ends (I have short hair, but I would expect, from the way my hair feels, that this would be the case)
9) Controls frizzy, unruly hair and adds shine (YES IT DOES!)
10) Suitable for all hair types (well, my hair is not in great shape normally, and Marvel 10 Effects has fixed that, so if  that counts as a vote for suitable for all hair types, so be it!)

In conclusion, I am amazed at this fantastic treatment! I do not know how to tell you how very much better my hair is since I began using this, but I will say that if you really do have concerns about taking good care of your hair, THIS PRODUCT,  Simply Beautiful Marvel 10 Effects 10 in 1 Hair Treatment, really does what it claims to do.
My hair has never looked better. I love this product! Because of it, I feel great about my pretty, shiny, silky and thick looking hair!

Thanks!

Even after I've applied Chapstick over the lipstick, very minimal color rubbed off but I think it's because I didn't exfoliate my lips this time.  The color lasted for about 8-10 hours for me.

"Generic Black Lace Temporary Tattoos for Adventurous Women, Teens &amp; Girls - Henna Tattoos Sticker W306-311(Pack of 2 Sheets)",5.0,"I am obsessed with henna tattoos, especially during summer. These are so betibd cute, and they last for several days. I've bought several packs now both in white and black.  I will say that I kind of like the white a bit better but the black are so pretty and I always get lots of compliments! They are definitely a great alternative to the super expensive name brand ones which Ive actually found do not last nearly as long.  The Bluezoo brand lasts for about a week.  They look great on and didn't give me a rash or anything and I have very sensitive skin. This product is amazing. Theyre great for raves or parties or outdoor music festivals and they are super  long lasting too especially when you are all sweaty from dancing  which is a big huge bonus. . They do last 2-3 days longer than the name brand tattoos,  but do become dull or more silvery over time. The application and removal were really easy -- just be sure to follow the directions and you really shouldn't have a problem at all. Hand sanitizer and / or baby wipes really aid in getting any and all residue off of your skin.

I literally had buy these when I saw them  - they look like actual hennaand I love that they are half the price of other tattoos, and I LOVE the look. Makes everyone double take. They don't feel pre-teen or cheesy and they can mimic the look of jewelry if you don't want to be too adventurous.
Apply them on clean dry skin, try not to scrub at them and it keeps looking fresh for over forty eight hours longer than other brands I have tried.

I think these are such a cute idea for a special event or to complement a nice tan! I decided to wear them like jewelry and I got a ton of complements - I wasn't expecting a long wear time but for me they lasted straight through my shower (about 2 days after application), not once but twice. I wore one on both of my inner wrists, one on my inner forearm and one under my upper back and was surprised that I couldn't feel them or notice any type of crunching or bunching up of the material. I have quite dry skin and don't know if this helped with the wear time but rubbing the skin and washing my hands had no effect on the tattoo at all.

Overall for the price I think they are a totally cute idea and I will definitely keep wearing one or two at a time until the package is done. I have shared them with my friends kids and they just raved about them.  Not sure what I will do with the really large ones. but I would totally say to give them a try! They're quite cute and very well worth it - they last a long time and they're high quality. I'll definitely be trying them in metallic as well.  These make incredible stocking suffers and great additions to birthday or Christmas presents  the fact that they come off so easily is wonderful because once you go back to work it looks a little unprofessional to be running around with these all over your arms  I haven't had an opportunity to use them on my legs or calves  I don't really think theyd look very good on that part of the body but I think putting them on the top of the foot could be a good way to wear them.

Overall  great buy especially for the price  I highly recommend!

If you found my review helpful please indicate so below  this helps me to know which reviews I leave have helped other buyers and which have not  I base a lot of my purchase decisions on reviews left by other purchasers so I take them seriously and leave my reviews very honestly  if you have any questions please leave them below .

"Victoria Featherlight - Best Organic Weight Loss Detox Slimming the Body Wrap Kit To Lose Weight Quickly, Includes Ebook",5.0,"This review is for the Victoria Featherlight - The Body Wrap Kit for Weight Loss, 8 Pieces for Cellulite, Arms, Detox Body Wrapping with Volcanic and Herbal Clay Wrappers.

I got these body wraps because I didn't want to spend the RIDICULOUS prices that one company ItWORKS was charging for their wraps. These are exactly the same and an absolute steal at the price the company is asking.

The box comes with 8 wraps and envelopes with the mix and bandages. There is a little DIY to this whole process. You have to soak the bandages it comes with in boiling water for 10-15 minutes and stir the powder in the envelopes until it forms a paste. Once you have achieved the desired consistency  you paint the mix onto your skin where you are going to place the bandages. It is fairly simple. You leave it on for 45-60 minutes for maximum results. Then take a shower and wash off!

You have to reuse the bandages the box provides. You can machine wash them or hand wash them and hang dry to prevent shrinkage. I was able to use all the bandages and I am a fairly large girl. They covered my body just fine.

The wraps work well and provided a toned look to my physique. It is almost like wearing SPANX but without the SPANX! I did these wraps before I went out for the night in a little dress and I looked a few pounds lighter. The box lets you know to use these for six weeks straight and then once a month for maintenance. Overall, they are totally worth the price you are paying for the novelty and the fact that these DO work. 5/5 stars!

If you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a discounted promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.",AOADTSGQ0CULN,4.666666666666667,5.0,4.0
"Victoria Featherlight - Best Organic Weight Loss Detox Slimming the Body Wrap Kit To Lose Weight Quickly, Includes Ebook",5.0,"This Victoria Featherlight Body Wrap Kit is pretty much a spa in your own home. I'm much bigger than the average woman so doing anything like this in an actual spa is out of the question. While this does say it's good for losing inches I mainly got this to try because it also said it helps reduce stretch marks; yes I would love to lose inches since I do have some clothes that are a little too tight I also would love to be able to see my stretch marks be gone.

I have only used this kit once so far as you only need to use it once a week for 6 weeks and then once a month but I can already tell you that I love it. This kit is super easy to use as it's got clear step by step instructions. The kit comes with 2 ace bandages and 8 packets of clay powder so you do get enough to be able to see if it'll even work. I love how relaxing this body wrap is and for a complete hour I get to relax while the clay sits and does it's magic.

I have sensitive skin and didn't have any problems at all using this kit; in fact the clay actually made my skin feel really soft and smooth after using it. I did notice that after just one use that my skin did feel like it was a little tighter than it normally is. I'm absolutely looking forward to the next 7 times I get to use this kit! I would definitely recommend this Victoria Featherlight Body Wrap Kit!

"Victoria Featherlight - Best Organic Weight Loss Detox Slimming the Body Wrap Kit To Lose Weight Quickly, Includes Ebook",4.0,"I've been losing weight (so far, 30 pounds, and 60 more to go).  Needless to say, this has left my flabby body even flabbier, with looser skin.  I was excited with offered this Detox Body Wrap at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.  It's fairly easy (though messy) to use.

* Boil some water, remove from heat, add the wraps (basically extra wide ace bandages) and allow to set for 10-15 minutes;
* After the water/wraps have cooled for 10-15 minutes, mix the clay powder with warm water and apply to the desired area;
* Remove wraps from water, wring until no longer dripping;
* When you burn yourself from wring the wraps, place them in a spagetti strainer to cool further, then wring the rest of the water out;
* Wrap the bandages around the desired area (I did my tummy), and secure with the included clips;
* When the clips break, go get some safety pins (which I should have got before I started all this), and use them to secure the wraps.
* Put a warm damp towel over the wraps (or do as I did and use neoprene wraps, which are better at holding in heat);
* Wait at least an hour before removing everything;
* Then clean up the mess you made, and measure yourself.

As you can see, there were a few kinks.  I needed to let the wraps cool longer before trying to use them, and the clips ALL bent to the point I was unable to use them.  That said, I noticed a definite improvement in my skin tone.  I've attached Before/After pictures (using a ""cutout"" artistic effect -- lets face it, nobody wants to see a fat, old tummy in Amazon's pictures).  You can see that I still have a lot of work to do, but the after picture showed definite improvement.  While I received this at a deep discount for review purposes, I plan on buying more of this product at full price to keep toning and tightening my skin as I lose more weight.  If I meet my goal weight, I will post picture of the final result.  I expect that will be mid-2016.",A16AXQ11SZA8SQ,4.666666666666667,4.0,4.0

"Premium Exfoliating Mitt for Bath &amp; Shower Cleansing - Reduce Cellulite, Resurface Skin, and Eliminate Acne - Exfoliator Mitt - A Spa Experience for Women &amp; Men - #1 Exfoliation Glove for Anti-Aging",4.0,"This is a medium-sized mitt with a layer of very rough, but strong fabric on both sides and an elastic band at the wrist to help it stay on. The fabric is held together by solid stitching which was flawless on my mitt. It is super strong despite being thin. The fabric is rather surprisingly rough when you rub it against your skin. It's like sandpaper that does not do any damage. It leaves your skin feeling smoother and cleaner after use because it so vigorously rubs off outer dead skin cells. If you have thin or super sensitive skin, I'm not sure how this would feel. I'm the sort of person who scratches hard, so I loved this. It felt effective and it felt invigorating. The type of rough stimulation likely stimulates blood vessels close to the surface of the skin. I wouldn't be surprised if it had positive effects in terms of cleaning through increased blood flow.

The only point about this which I was not happy about was the inner seem around the elastic band at the bottom (see photo). The interior is stitched well, but it is also sealed at the edges with what seems to be melted plastic. Mine had sharp edges that I had to trim off with scissors in order to stop it from digging into my wrists uncomfortably. This ragged edge should be more refined. Though cutting it off isn't difficult, I'm concerned that cutting off too much will result in fraying the elastic resulting it in eventually unraveling so one must trim lightly and carefully.

Contouring Slimming Ultimate All Natural Body Wrap 10 Applications,5.0,"These wraps have clearly become all the rage and after trying not to follow the hype I finally caved about a month ago and since have tried several different styles and brands.  I have to say that I really do like these contouring wraps from  Shape and Tone Body Products, I think the little heart shaped cut out for the belly button was a very nice touch.  I've been working to lose weight but even though I've managed to lose about 15 pounds so far I was a little upset over the loose skin so I was pretty excited to see if these would help and since they were delivered I've done 5 applications and I have to admit, I'm seeing results.  These wraps are a lot different from others I've tried - they are comfy to wear, they don't leave behind a sticky mess when you remove them and it actually feels like your skin is tightening up.  These wraps are fairly large too, so you can actually cut the wrap, depending on your size, and use it on your stomach area and have some left over for your upper arms, that's what I've been doing each time I apply and so far I see moderate changes in my upper arm area but hoping in time I see a lot more.  I apply my wraps before bed but you can use them any time that works for you, they can even be worn in the shower.  The package advises wearing these fairly consecutively in the beginning, I alternated every other day but you can do whatever works best for you.  This item was supplied to me at no cost during a promotion by the seller in order to evaluate and share my experience. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest & unbiased opinion.

Contouring Slimming Ultimate All Natural Body Wrap 10 Applications,4.0,"While on my weightloss journey of losing 45 pounds, I have lost 25. I have loose skin from having a baby and post partum blues made me eat eat eat! I've been trying to make healthy choices such as drinking lots of water, exercising frequently and eating nutritiously. I easily lost 20 pounds, struggled during the last 5 pounds. I have some loose skin that occasionaly needs to be tightened with wraps. These wraps do a great job of making my skin feel more firm. Although I don't get much shrinkage (about an inch and a half each use), these wraps are great for short term results when I need to show my stomach in public like at a pool. The results from the wrap lasts for about 24-48 hours for me before I go back to my normal inches. These wraps are large and can be cut up to use other areas other than the stomach. I don't like to wear these wraps overnight although many people do , because I like to drink tons of water to flush the toxins. I'm talking about drinking 120 ounces at least!!! The wraps stick on and don't leave any residue upon removal. Recommended product! I do wish that I lost more inches from it, though.

"Nail Art Stamper,DANCINGNAIL Beauty Lady Nail Art Scraper Stamping Manicure Polish Plate Double Ended Stamper Image Tool Kit Set And Nail Plate",5.0,"This review is for the DANCINGNAIL Beauty Lady Nail Art Scraper Stamping Manicure Polish Plate Double Ended Stamper Image Tool Kit Set and Nail Plate.

This nail stamper kit is similar to ones I have purchased from KONAD designs before. What I love about this kit is the various types of stampers included. I wanted to see if one was easier to use then my Konad with my nail plates.

These stampers are made from plastic and rubber. What you do is fill the nail plate designs (one of your choice) with nail polish, use the scraper over to the top to take off the excess polish, clean the rubber stamper part with acetone to ensure it is clean, and then put the rubber stamper down on the nail plate design with the polish to pick it up. It quickly transfers to your rubber, and you stamp it on your nail.

There are some tips for using these, First.. Be sure once you transfer to your CLEAN stamper plate, you stamp it IMMEDIATELY on your nail so the polish doesnt dry. Second, you REALLY only want to use stamping polish with these. I have a TON of colors from Konad  but honestly regular solid nail polish doesnt work too well. The METALLIC polishes DO work great (any brand).

Once you have transferred the design to your nail, wipe off the rubber with acetone and pick the next design and repeat These stampers work as good as the Konad brand, I love the mini stamper, it was hard to get small designs with the larger rubber ball of the medium stamper, so the mini rubber ball makes it simple to see where I am going on my nail. The plates are also deep enough that ALL design transfers unlike some of those other brands which make cheap plates. A good set to get you started in the world of nail stamping!

3 Angles-I like the angles and adjustments (as shown in the description page). I found this mirror so easy to adjust.

"Dark Spot Corrector - Sun Spot Remover, 1 fl oz",5.0,"Searching for a safe and effective skin brightener is always my top priority because I have a never ending battle with skin discoloration and dark sunspots. I love the fact that this serum is gentle and does not contain the harsh chemicals that most skin lighteners do because I prefer using products that have natural and botanical ingredients as much as possible. This product comes in a dark amber dropper bottle which protects the product from sunlight exposure. It also contains Glycolic and Kojic Acids as the key ingredients which I believe will lead to clear and brighter looking skin. This serum keeps my skin smooth, shining and flake-free. It is not greasy and does not form a film. I have somewhat sensitive skin which is pone to irritation and redness, but this serum is very gentle without causing any breakouts or negative side effects. I believe it has been gradually improving my dull looking appearance by making the spots a bit lighter.

I use the product as directed after cleansing, toning my face and allowing some time to dry before topping with my regular moisturizer. This light weight clear serum not only applies smoothly and evenly, but it also has a fresh light scent that will dissipate after it dries. It has a liquid gel like texture which leaves my skin soft and smooth, not to mention it is also fast absorbing without any uncomfortable feeling and leaves my face quite moisturized. I have even started using it to lighten the sun spots on my hands and the results are impressive. Although I have not been using it for long, my skin tone has started to look more even and I have also noticed that some of my blemishes have cleared up along the way. My darker spots still exist, but they look much better and I can see some significant improvements of my lighter ones.

I am sure everyone's skin is different, but I have experienced zero sensitivity or dryness. I love how much clearer my skin looks throughout the day and my skin feels more balanced. My overall appearance is much brighter and smoother. The brown spots on my hands are slowly fading in under two weeks and I can say that I am really happy about it. In fact, everybody's skin type is different and the effects may not be the same or visible for everyone. I have used it twice a day for quite some time now and the brightening effect seems to be progressing. There is no miraculous or overnight whitening as such, but with gradual fading of sun spots, my face does appear clearer and even toned. This product does what it promises and lightens my dark spots. This is a great and reasonably priced dark spot corrector serum that I will definitely buy again and I feel quite confident to explore other products from the same line to further improve my skin conditions.

Disclosure: I purchased this dark spot corrector at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.",A2XZM64TLWL34O,4.333333333333333,5.0,4.0

"Ultimate Toning and Firming Body Applicator, Body Wrap, 4 Wraps. New Improved Formula - it works for Skin Tightening Toning Firming",4.0,"Overview: I had a baby a year and a half ago, and gained forty pounds that wouldn't budge. I lost 20 lbs on my own, but the last 25 have been stubborn. After losing 4 more pounds, I still haven't seen the shrinkage in my waistline. Yes, my arms, face, thighs shrink, but the c-section pooch is still there. I got these wraps hoping that I will be able to see some of my loose skin firms up to get rid of the pooch I have. I wear a size large in shirts and size 10 in pants. Before the wrap, my waist measured 36 inches, and after 4 hours using the wrap drinking TONS of water, my waist measured 34.5. 1.5 inches down!

The wraps are not a cream color as shown in the image. They are clear with gel on the inside.

Pros:
-Inches shrunk. My waistline didn't visibly shrink, but it did physically shrink as I lost 1.5 inches. I would have loved to have lost more from the wraps like other ladies.
-Skin felt taut. The skin felt firm upon removal of the wrap. It says to rub the rest of the gel in, but I just wanted to shower the gel off :/
-LARGE. These wraps covered down my pooch under my hip bones, across and around to my back(hips) and even up to my ribcage. I could totally see cutting one in many parts to use it in different areas of the body. You would need some shaaaaarp scissors.
-Easy application. Once you unfold the wrap, it is easy to slap it on and wrap in some plastic wrap. It stays in place.

Cons:
-Plastic wrap. The plastic wrap squinches as you move. It says overnight, but I want to drink water while wearing it! I'd leave it for an at-home spa day.
-Smell. The gel smells like the numbing agent they use at the dentist's office. It made me gag a bit. As soon as the plastic wrap is applied, the smell is no longer apparent.

Grade: This product receives 4 stars because it made me lose inches, but it stinkies!

"Sol De Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream, 8.1 Fl oz",4.0,"After so much hype, I felt compelled to try it myself, especially since I now live in the desert and in the last couple of weeks, there were a couple of d days where it was 107+ at 4% humidity. (Did you even know that was possible?)

- Moisturizing: off the bat, I'll say that if you put this on after your shower on still-wet/moist skin, it absorbs beautifully and really hydrates your skin. It's not just about looking moisturized, but you FEEL moisturized. For a good 1-2 hours post-shower, I am consistently amazed by that feeling of moisture just creeping into my skin, even though it doesn't look like I have any cream left on my body.

- Scent: Unlike others who rave about the scent, I am not a huge fan of the scent. I tend to love my cocoa-butter scented items or things reminiscent of suntan lotion which conjures up images of Hawaiian beaches or sipping a cocktail in Fiji when you're in mid-city traffic. I like how this is heavily scented -- but the scent is more ""warm"" than ""beautiful,"" if that makes any sense. I actually prefer the scent half a day later when you can still whiff some remnants on your skin. That said, it's amazing that when you sweat, the scent comes back to life so I suppose for some who get stinky when they sweat, this is a good thing. Note: I also use this with the body perfume from the same brand...my motto in life is ""Go big or go home,"" what can I say?

- Price: I don't care about the price of the jar itself, but given the amount I use after every shower, which I take every single day, I think one jar will last me about 30-40 days. THEN, this jar is expensive, especially compared to other body lotions and creams. One of my long-time favorites --&nbsp;Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula With Vitamin E Lotion Fragrance Free , 13.5-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)&nbsp;-- is less than $30 for FOUR bottles that are 13.5 ounce each -- and every single bit as moisturizing. Your skin feels like a baby's bottom for the entire day with this stuff. While this is not a scientific claim, I daresay the Palmer's will penetrate more and leave your skin softer overall -- but the BBC instantly absorbs more. Can I justify buying Brazilian Bum Bum Cream when these bottles I have everywhere in my house moisturize just as well, if not more? The four bottles I buy at a time lasts me over a year -- and I have one by the kitchen for my hands, one in my office for random ""OMG I WANT TO MOISTURIZE"" moments, one in the car, and one in my master bath, where the BBC now resides as well. Buying four jars of BBC -- almost $200. No thanks.

Finally -- the sparkles. I am not big on having sparkles on my skin. It's not an excessive amount, but it's definitely there. I like a glow as much as anyone--but I like it oil and moisture-based. Sparkles -- not too crazy about. Then again, maybe it looks fabulous under a disco ball, which I haven't been under in eons. But for daily usage, I'm not big on the sparkles.

For these reasons, I don't think I'll be repurchasing, but it is a very nice body cream. I'll save the rest of the jar for occasions when I am going out and want to smell like an island, but for daily usage, this is not really a worthwhile purchase.

This custardy, thick, whipped creme practically vanishes into your skin with a few rubs, leaving a faint silky trace - no oiliness or greasiness -- behaving like a light body lotion in this sense. You can get dressed immediately without ruining your clothes. Incredible softening texture. A pleasure for those who love to lavishly slather on indulgent butters without the 'slip n slide' factor.

The fragrance is very strong. It can double as perfume, and lasts a whole day. At first, i relished the fruity-nutty-toffee gourmand scent. But after an entire day, it got cloying; almost nauseating-- and the strength just can't be dialed down if you applied it all over. But if you love the smell, then, Bravo! you've just saved money not having to buying separate perfume.

The only negative is that, for the high price, it should really contain higher levels of plant-based oils and botanicals. The cupuacu, guarana, acai, cocoa butter and other ""brazilian"" extracts are listed AFTER the fragrance, which shows that they are at minimal levels (possibly single-digit % or less).

"True Glow Eye Cream - Intense Dark Circles Corrector - Natural and Organic Ingredients - with Vitamin C, Astaxanthin, Arnica and Organic Rosehip Oil - 1.18 Oz",5.0,"Next on the Valentia beauty line, comes the True Glow Eye Cream for review. I use eye creams and serums on a daily basis and twice a day because I find this area tends to reflect signs of aging sooner than the rest of my face. My goal is to always keep this area hydrated and moisturized at all times because of this!

Valentia's True Glow Eye Cream comes in a glass bottle with a pump action top. The product advertises as being an Intense Corrective Eye treatment, which not only works as a preventing regimen but also aids with current issues. The eye cream helps with:

Reducing Fine lines and Wrinkles
Restoring Radiance by helping repair and nourish the delicate skin around our eyes
Hydration from oils to Anti-inflammatory ingredients to reduce puffiness that may further diminish the appearance of aging skin.
Tightening the area around the eye by aiding with elasticity and targeting dark circles. which can make a person look tired and cause an irregular skin tone/color effect to the area.

Retail Price Point: $25.00 via Amazon for a 1.18 ounce glass bottle with a pump action top.

Verdict:
I always give myself about 3 to 4 weeks when it comes to trying any beauty creams and serums. I need to know if the effects I experience belong to the product I am testing or they are just the remaining benefits from the one prior. I can then also get an idea how well a product performs! The first week of trying the eye cream from Valentia, I noticed the product tends to linger longer on the skin than my former eye cream. As much as I love quick absorbing products, my prior eye cream left no residue but also no hydrating protective layer. It would just vanish within four hours and if the day was even breezy in nature, I could feel that tight feeling your skin gets when it's drying out too much. The True Glow Eye Cream from Valentia left a protective layer that kept my skin looking smoother longer through out the day. I used the product twice a day and experienced zero irritations from use. The thin layer allowed for make-up application after and no odd little rolled up residue balls formed hours later, or worse, when your make-up separates making it look like you forgot to blend. None of that happened! I did not notice fine line repair by week three, but I can state that the product is phenomenal went it comes to working as a prevention aid. I looked more awake because the skin in that area was smooth and naturally plump, not swollen from my seasonal allergies! My eyes water at night and when I sleep, creating what I call ""teary eyes"". I get red streaks from the irritation if I forget to apply eye cream or applied a poorly formulated one. I can state the Valentia's True Glow Eye cream prevented any red marks from setting in, so I woke up looking fresh and not like I have been weeping! This is an eye cream I would continue to use but also along with the Ultra Plumping Hydrating Mask from Valentia. These two products help each other out and I get a balanced appearance that is noticeable with this duo.

I received the above product(s) free of charge from Valentia. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion. My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.",A6P370Q9YB27F,5.0,5.0,4.0
"True Glow Eye Cream - Intense Dark Circles Corrector - Natural and Organic Ingredients - with Vitamin C, Astaxanthin, Arnica and Organic Rosehip Oil - 1.18 Oz",5.0,"I have been using both the True Glow Eye Cream and the Ultra Plumping Hydration Mask for about a month now with nice results. I use the True Glow Eye Cream every night to reduce the bags under my eyes and the Ultra Hydration Mask twice a week.

I love how my skin feels after the mask. Both products are orangy in color and the mask has a pleasant smell. Even though it is orange it quickly absorbs and dry with no tight feeling, or, at least, I didn't experience. The instructions state to leave on for 15-30 minutes of which I did the full 30 minutes. I have used some masks that dry and crack and scare small children and pets, but with this hydration mask, you don't have that. You can go about your business, well at home anyway, then rinse off after the allotted time. The skin on my face felt nice and smooth and soft.

The True Glow Eye Cream I applied every night after cleansing, it absorbs quickly. I am 62 so the use of products that aid in the aging process is important to me. The use of organic and natural ingredients is extremely important also. You spend a lifetime being exposed to chemicals and other toxic things just in the air you breathe. I want a good quality product that assists me in what I need in an anti-aging product. I really like both of these products.

"True Glow Eye Cream - Intense Dark Circles Corrector - Natural and Organic Ingredients - with Vitamin C, Astaxanthin, Arnica and Organic Rosehip Oil - 1.18 Oz",5.0,"This True Glow Eye Cream glides over my skin smoothly and absorbs quickly leaving my eyes refreshed and hydrated.  It doesn't leave behind any unwanted greasy or sticky residue and wears all day under my makeup.  The plant stem cells visibly improve the appearance of fine lines while the strong antioxidants neutralize free radical damage that is encountered daily and prompts collagen production.  This protects the delicate under eye area and improves your skin texture.  The Arnica works to stimulate white blood cell activity, relieving trapped fluid and bruising, thus leaving your eyes refreshed and brightened.  The naturally derived Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, which is a unique type of Vitamin C that's known as one of the most effective and deeply penetrating antioxidants, gives this eye cream an extra boost by improving skin circulation.  This leaves your under eye area looking well-rested for that bright-eyed look we all desire.  Since the skin around our eyes is thinner and more fragile than the rest of the facial area, it needs deep hydration to remain soft and toned.  The ingredients organic rosehip oil, botanical hyaluronic acid and their proprietary silk protein amino acid blend are nature's most powerful sources for this needed hydration.  This True Glow Eye Cream contains a balanced formula for both day and night usage.

I recently reviewed another eye cream where I talked about other uses to make it a multi-tasking product.  Therefore, for the purpose of this review entry, I want to address a few dos and don'ts when it comes to applying your eye cream.  That's why I'm going to share an article that was published by Into The Gloss in 2014.

Tapping, dabbing, massaging. Everyone applies eye cream a little differently, like we're each a special, puffiness-hating snowflake. But should you actually be putting the stuff on all willy nilly, or is there an objectively superior application method? The truth is...slightly complicated. It's less that there's a single correct strategy, and more that there are lid hydration best practices. This isn't just something we thought up on our own (although our inner lives are vast!)dermatologists agree. ""I don't think there is any one right way,"" one doctor admits. ""Basically, you should be gentle."" But what does gentle even mean? Gentle like 'pretend your face is an antique silk wedding dress once owned by Princess Grace of Monaco', or gentle like 'just don't give yourself contact dermatitis'? To clear up what, exactly, anything related to eye cream is about, he has a few useful pointers:

DO TAP AND/OR MASSAGE
""Soft massage and patting are both great,"" the doctor advises. You can press the cream in, you can try light, sweeping strokes, or you can even put it on a cotton round and leave it on under your eyes for a couple of minutes.

DON'T PULL AT YOUR SKIN
""You don't want any stretching,"" he says. ""The skin under the eye is a different structure from the rest of the face; it's more delicate."" So if you're really moving your skin around when you rub cream in, you're probably doing it too hard.

DO LET IT SINK IN
Give your eye cream about a minute (or longer, if possible) to absorb before you put makeup on top of it. That way, your powder or concealer won't cake up from the extra emollient base in the eye cream.

DON'T PUT ON TOO MUCH
If you pack on the product, it won't make it more effective. It will, however, creep into your eyes and irritate them. Just put a pea-sized dab on your ring finger, then dot it on your brow bone and about a half inch underneath your eye. That's all!

Granted, the information above is probably not new to most people, yet I found it necessary to share anyhow.  The reason why it's important is because the area around our eyes is extremely delicate and should in essence be treated with kid gloves.  I don't know how many times I've seen people apply eye cream like they would body butter (vigorously).  Every time I witness this, I cringe a little inside and step in like they've committed a skin care felony.  I'm very passionate about proper skin care because no matter what, we're stuck with the skin we were born with and we need to do what we can to keep it as healthy as we can for as long as we can.

That being said, I absolutely love this eye cream.  Honestly, I love all the Valentia products I have had the pleasure of trying and using.  They have an exceptional skin care line that I recommend for all skin types.  I have been using their products for almost a year and have not experienced any adverse reactions.  Not to mention when I use this under my concealer and foundation, it doesn't make my makeup look cakey in the least.  You really can't ask for much more in a skin care product.

"Tweezers for Eyelash Extensions - Set of 3 - Strong Grip, Stainless Steel, Tube Case. Needlepoint for Ingrown Hair, Eyebrow Shaping, Extractions. Great for Tiny Electronic Components",5.0,"I've used many different tweezers over the years and really hadn't found a pair I totally loved.  This set has turned out to be perfect - I've been using two of them for several months now, and highly recommend them.

The regular slant tweezers do such a great job with plucking.  They have such a precision tip that they don't break off the hairs.  They grip securely every time and avoid the breakage that causes ingrown hairs.  I've also used the needle tip ones to remove ingrown hairs left by other tweezers and I love that they are super sharp and pointed - quickly grasping the hair under the skin and removing it without tearing up my skin.  They would also work very well to remove splinters without having to dig.  The curved tweezers are also very nice but I haven't needed to use them yet.  I imagine they would be good for placing small items for gluing, or for reaching into very small openings to retrieve something.

The whole set is made of high quality stainless steel, which makes them easy to disinfect with alcohol or soap and water.  The handles are brushed to give a more secure grip and the size of them (about 4 inches) is perfect for the average hand. Being stainless steel, they won't ever rust and the edges will stay sharp and aligned for many years.  I received the silver colored set, although the product page says they come in 4 colors.

I actually threw away my Tweezerman tweezers after I started using the Beneleaf tweezers. I didn't realize how much extra work the Tweezerman ones cost me in repeatedly plucking the same hair, broken hairs and later ingrown hairs. Plus my Tweezerman tweezers were $20, and this set of 3 Beneleaf precision tweezers is $23!  If you are also fighting a cheap or worn out set of tweezers, I highly recommend this Beneleaf set.

I received a complimentary set of Beneleaf professional tweezers for testing and review purposes.

Skederm Vitamin C X30 Aqua Serum. Hyaluronic Acid with Argireline. 1 fl. oz. / 30ml,5.0,"I was very excited to try out this vitamin C serum from Skederm. This is my first time trying a Skederm product, and I was curious to see how well it performed.

I like the packaging of this product. It is clean, simple, and to the point. I love that it comes in a bottle with a pump; very hygienic and easy to use! A pump was enough serum to cover my whole face and some of my neck, which means that this bottle will last me a long time. The serum itself has a light and pleasant scent. The scent wasn't noticeable once I applied the product to my face. The serum went smoothly onto my face. As it was absorbing into my skin, my face felt sticky. That went away completely in a couple of minutes and I was left with very soft skin. I use this product in the morning under my makeup, and it does help to make my face brighter and look more awake in the morning! I have noticed that with regular use of this serum, my skin is brighter and my fine lines are diminishing, which is amazing!

Vitamin C serums can be used for more than just the face. Vitamin C is great for helping with stretch marks and aging hands. My mother has always used vitamin C on her hands, and as a result her hands look very young for her age! I am excited to try this serum for this purpose as well!

Vitamin C is known to help with fading scars, firming skin, and reducing inflammation. This serum also has other ingredients that are beneficial for the skin in terms of anti-aging, acne, and redness. Hyaluronic acid is amazing for the skin and it's something that everyone should be using on their face. This serum also has many other ingredients that are great for the skin. There aren't any ingredients that I do not trust putting on my face! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",A3OU5DEQVEJC2S,5.0,5.0,4.0
Svelta Tan Self Tanning Mitt / Patented Design / Flawless Streak-Free Application for Sunless Tanning,3.0,"This tanning mitt is nice.

I was very pleasantly surprised at how much of a difference it made in the experience of applying fake tanner. It made a huge difference in how my hands turned out and I have no weird stains on my hands or wrists, which was a problem for me. I also felt like I could take my time a little bit more, without having to worry about the product being on my hands and staining them.

As for performance, it's not really the best performing oil I've ever used. While not to heavy, it just doesn't feel as rich or nourishing as I was hoping for. Plus, when I first apply it feels slightly stinging, it goes away quickly but combined with the heavy scent and the underwhelming performance I'm not going to be repurchasing.

Living Nature Pure Antibacterial Manuka Oil,5.0,"Manuka Oil is a new oil to me so I was excited to try it out because I have been testing some new products out and I ended up with some cystic acne (I think I narrowed it down to the Estee Lauder Matte Perfecting Primer as the culprit).  Manuka Oil is a lot like Tea Tree Oil in that it's anti-inflammatory and antibacterial which makes it perfect to use on blemishes to speed up healing and recovery.
This Manuka Oil by Natural Beauty Limited is a 100% pure and natural essential oil and I have to say that it worked wonders on my spots.  Normally, when I have a bad reaction like the one that I had it takes weeks to heal but I started seeing results in a matter of days.  I was very consistent and used the Manuka Oil twice a day directly on the spots.  Manuka Oil is also Cicatrisant and Cytophylactic which helps promote new cell growth and healing and It think is a big reason why I saw such immediate results.
Manuka Oil and Tea Tree Oil have a lot of similarities, smell being one of them, but I feel like I had better results with the Manuka Oil than I've ever had with Tea Tree Oil.  Not sure why and it could even be because I was so consistent with the application of the Manuka Oil but whatever the reason I will be keeping the Manuka Oil on hand at all times!

essie 2016 Retro Revival Trend Nail Polish,5.0,"Legend has it that after Essie discontinued Starry Starry Night (introduced in 1985) that women worldwide kept searching high and low for the amazing nail polish. So much so that rare bottles popped up on ebay, bringing hundreds of dollars.

No need to run up your credit card anymore! Essie reintroduced SSN (that's for 'Starry Starry Night,' not your social security number) in its Retro Revival Collection, and the polish sold out online in a nanosecond. The good news is that it's just now coming into your local Essie retailer, so pick up a bottle or two as a backup.

This polish is worth the hype. It's amazing, kind of like a navy jelly base with the subtle silver glimmer of a million stars in a sky unmarred by light pollution. I absolutely adore it (and yes, I picked up a spare, since this polish is that wonderful.)

Unlike some reviewers' experiences, I found the formula to be fine, not thick, not goopy. I used a base coat, as you should with anything this dark to prevent staining, and I got full opacity in two coats. The polish last almost a week before signs of chipping, and even then, it was minimal. (Your mileage may vary.)

Old timers say that this isn't quite the same as the original SSN; that may be true, but ignorance is bliss in my case. I love this polish! (And I'm not bidding $$$ for the original, either.) Even if you don't normally gravitate towards dark polishes, give this one a try. I'm sure you'll love it, and if you don't...well, you can send it to me! I'll make sure it gets a good home!",A2JCJJNY43QQIV,5.0,5.0,4.0

Skederm Vitamin C X30 Power Serum. Hyaluronic Acid with Aquaxyl. 1 fl. oz.,5.0,"I am not a stranger to Vitamin C skincare products, but this power serum by Skederm is very different from all the Vitamin C serums that I have tried before. I always have ongoing problems of uneven skin tone and under eye dark circles. This special blend of serum is formulated to target signs of aging including dark spots, skin dehydration and dull skin tones. Unfortunately, it is exactly what I need at this point of my life. It may not be fast and effective against deep wrinkles though, but nothing really is other than cosmetic surgeries. The serum is quickly absorbed into the skin and does not feel greasy or gel-like silicone texture that a lot of serums have. It does have a pleasant light scent which quickly dissipates after applied and the consistency of the serum is somewhat creamy. It spreads very easily and one pump is enough to cover my face so the bottle should last quite awhile. When I apply this serum after cleansing and toning, I immediately feel as if my skin has been infused with moisture. It soaks right in and makes my skin feel more hydrated. It feels smooth and luxurious when I spread it over my face and neck. I have not experienced any irritation or negative reaction to this serum. Nevertheless, it is gentle enough to apply even under my eyes without any burning or itching sensation which has happened with a lot of beauty products I tried over the years.

I really adore the elegant packaging, it comes in a beautiful airtight pump style bottle which protects the ingredients and keeps them fresh. It's sanitary and dispenses just the right amount for each application. I instantly love the way it makes my face feel soft and supple on first use and the results over the past week alone have continued to smooth my skin significantly. My face looks and feels more smooth, firm, and has this radiant glow that makes me look so much energetic. It has also helped balance my overall complexion. Even though I have exclusively been using this serum for about a week. I do not expect it to work miracles, but if it can hold moisture to the surface of my skin to give it the appearance of being smoother, then it is doing exactly what I need it to do. I do notice after using it that my skin feels tighter. I have not noticed any change in my fine lines yet, but the texture of my skin is starting to look better already. I am pleased with what I have seen so far and I am fully aware that I should give it at least a month to see results just like with any skincare product on the market. I will continue using this serum to document what my results are over time.

Disclosure: I purchased this serum at a discount for my honest opinion.",A2XZM64TLWL34O,5.0,5.0,4.0
Skederm Vitamin C X30 Power Serum. Hyaluronic Acid with Aquaxyl. 1 fl. oz.,5.0,"I've tried several serums and like many of them... But Skederm's is one of my favorites.  The spots on the side of my mouth are noticeably lighter.  It has a thin texture and absorbs quickly without any sticky residue.  But it's not primarily water.  Nothing against water, but I prefer my serums to have some thickness to them to allow the ingredients time to penetrate my skin.  This one has the feel of a light cream and a soft citrus scent.  Also the ingredients are superior.  It has the sodium hyaluronate version of HA, biotin, squalane and most importantly 3-O Ethyl Abscorbic acid.  Also the unique pump top bottle gives me full control and delays oxidation.  Highly recommended

I mean, this is more than a step-up from conventional files of emory or steel; noticeable differences stand out immediately. I can really appreciate the way my fingernails felt as I shaped them; quite a difference in the rough grinding.

I have the Lamora kabuki set and the denseness of the two kabuki brushes that come with this set is close.  The problem with the Lamora set is that it has no eye makeup brushes so after you've spent almost $40 on the brushes (they are great brushes by the way), you really need to spend another $20 for the eye makeup set.  The brushes are worth it if you have the money to spend and want very specialized brushes for your eye makeup.  This set has just enough brushes including foundation, blush, and four brushes specifically for eye makeup and doesn't break the bank at $35.  These brushes are very soft too.

"Yes To Cucumber Hypoallergenic Facial Towelettes, 30 Count (Pack of 6)",4.0,"This is the latest product I tried in my seemingly never-ending search for the perfect makeup remover.  I'm partial to wipes and towelettes because of the convenience -- both remover product and applicator in one (no running out of cotton balls or cotton pads at a different time than the remover product).

I'd previously tried some eye makeup remover pads (circular, in a screw-top canister) from Yes to Cucumbers and I hadn't been thrilled with those because they made my eyes water a bit.  However, these towelettes have been fine to use around my eyes -- usually quite gentle, in fact.  I've been using them to remove mascara and they've been doing an exceptional job; they're also pretty good at removing lip stains.

I like the packaging on the larger package sizes (i.e., 30 count).  The plastic cover snaps shut and keeps the towelettes from drying out, which is great since I only use maybe five of these a week so the whole package lasts for a month and a half.  It's a lot better than the wipe/towelette packages that only have a sticky flap to press over the opening (these have the sticky flap, too, but also the plastic door).

I have somewhat sensitive skin but this has not bothered me very much in that respect.  I don't notice much of a smell when I use these, either.

The other thing I really like is the size -- if you need to rub a little bit to get all your eye makeup off, you can constantly move to a fresh area of the towelette, or switch to the other side (the sides are equivalent in terms of texture), so you can actually get the makeup off instead of moving it around.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,4.5,4.0,4.0

I also notice that since using this shaver, it takes my hair longer to grow back and it's painless as well.

"Dove Men+Care, Deep Clean Body + Face Bar, 4 Ounce, 6 Count, (Pack of 2)&hellip;",5.0,"I do not use this soap for my face since I have very sensitive skin and need fragrance free cleansers, but for an all-over body cleanse, I'm literally SHOCKED by how great this soap is from Dove. It leaves your skin feeling moist and clean, with a subtle but fresh scent. Usually my body feels very taut and dry after using bar-soaps, but not with this product.

The texture of the soap is best compared to the few ""organic"" soaps I've tried, which I love. The ""micro-grains"" are a nice added touch. They probably don't do anything--in theory they 'exfoliate' and 'remove dead skin cells'--but most importantly I like the way it feels. The soap lasts a long time too and doesn't shrink the second it gets wet (like most mainstream bars).

OVERALL: I would not recommend this for your face (even if you don't have normally sensitive skin) because I think it would be too harsh, but for the rest of your body - prepare to be amazed! This is a gentle bar soap that won't leave your skin feeling dry, smells great, and will keep you clean. I've tried bar soaps off and on, mostly off because I've been so disappointed by them, but this actually made me want to start using them again. Very impressed, Dove!

As mentioned the scent is strong but lessens when you use the soap. It is hard to describe the scent. It is not a perfume or cologne scent but more of a clean soap smell. I can smell it on my hands after using the soap and it smells fine.

The soap is slightly rounded and shaped so it is easy to hold and easy to use on my body. The color is not the clean white you get in some Dove soaps but a darker color that I would expect in a product that has ""purifying grains.""

To give you an idea of how scented it is, we received some of the Dove&nbsp;Dove Men Care Body and Face Wash--Clean Defense&nbsp;and while I liked it on my man, there's no way I would personally use it.  The scent was just over-powering in the shower.

This bar though is mild in comparison and very pleasant.  About on par with the normal pink or green Dove bar soap that we sometimes purchase.  (I think the white has the least smell.  White Dove is our household standard.)

Second, I like how it didn't dry out my skin.  It's Winter and my skins a dry mess right now, but this bar doesn't appear to be making the situation worse.

"Dove Men+Care, Deep Clean Body + Face Bar, 4 Ounce, 6 Count, (Pack of 2)&hellip;",4.0,"I tend to be the sort of person who just buys the cheapest soap with the lightest scent available rather than try to find something with particular qualities. However, after using this soap, I may have to rethink that habit. This soap really does seem to leave skin feeling both clean (with no film left after rinsing) and quite soft. The claims on the back about containing 1/4 moisturizing cream appear to be quite true. Compared to the sometimes tight, post shower feel that I get with my usual choice of soap (generally the plain Kirkland brand at Costco), this is clearly a superior bar of soap.

The only drawback to this soap is the scent, which is the usual strong smell for men's hair and body products. If it were a little less intense, it'd be okay, but it is so strong that the paper box the soap comes in reeks of it. If you're okay with the strong smell and you want something which leaves you very clean but still with soft skin, this is a pretty good choice which is several cuts above the cheap stuff.",A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,4.833333333333333,4.0,4.0

It is gentle enough to use on the face as it contains both moisturizing cream and mild exfoliants. As it is marketed to men,it has a strong woodsy/green aroma. I personally prefer the freshness one finds in most men's fragrances. I liked this one but  less is more. Although the scent dissipates somewhat, it is still quite noticeable. Therefore, I think it is better used as a body bar than a facial cleanser.

My experience with Dove products has been positive. They are good quality and reasonably priced. I think most men would be receptive to skin care but I think that subtle fragrance is more appealing than aggressive perfumes.",A2OCDK0BOW6UCY,4.833333333333333,4.0,4.0

"Dove Men+Care, Deep Clean Body + Face Bar, 4 Ounce, 6 Count, (Pack of 2)&hellip;",5.0,"I was surprised when I recently saw this product in the store.  Seems it has been around for a while and I had missed it somehow.  I confess that in the past I have washed with my wifes Dove bar.  I loved the scent and the luxury of it.  But it was a little too strong and slippery for me, and it didn't do too well when I was really dirty.  This mens Dove has a great spicy masculine scent and really does a great job of deep cleaning.  I have used both the fresh and the deep cleaning and prefer the deep cleaning.  The extra fresh I would recommend for those that really need a deodorant soap.  In either case however, one thing I really love about this soap is its ability really get you clean, and at the same time moisturize your skin.  Dry skin is a real problem for many here in New England in winter when the air is so bone dry.  Washing down with this really has helped, and, unlike the ladies Dove, you really feel clean in spite of the moisturizing ability.  Trust me guys, a cake of this stuff will spoil you.  It's great.

The only thing I can say that I don't like about this soap is that it gets used up very quickly.  In no time it seems the bar is down and its time to crack open another one.  Gets a little expensive in an area that most of us don't consider a budget to be much of a factor.  But for what it is and does, this Mens Dove is well worth the expense, and is an excellent soap that I highly recommend... : )",A35W3JQYP0M655,4.833333333333333,5.0,4.0

"Piero Lorenzo NT-01 Heavy Duty Metal Garden Hose Nozzle Sprayer / Car Wash Gun- 7 Spraying Patterns - High Pressure - For Car / Pet Washing, Garden/Lawn Watering,Deck/Floor Cleaning7 Spraying Patterns",5.0,"I was a bit worried when this hose nozzle first arrived because there was a black insert where it connects to a hose.  Im not sure but maybe the black piece is included because it might be compatible with some quick connect systems.  I have standard hoses, and fortunately the black plastic piece can be easily removed with either a crescent wrench or an 11/16 open end wrench.

I have love-hate relationships with anything hose relatedhoses either kink or nozzles don't thread well.  This one gets five stars for such smooth threadingvery good grooves make for a quick connection and there is absolutely no leaking when a washer is put inside.  A washer was not included with my nozzle, but I think the black adapter piece (shown in picture) might be the better deal.  Any avid gardener has lots of available hose washers for occasions just like this.

The nozzle performs well in any of the seven settings.  The true test is longevityI have never had a multi-spray nozzle that has lasted more than two seasons.  However, its reassuring that Crenova offers a 12 month replacement warranty and a 60 day money back guarantee.  I was provided this nozzle for free in return for constructive feedback and an unbiased review.  Ive only had this solidly built nozzle a relatively short time, but like every aspect about it.  Should something change within a years time, I will provide an update.  Im hoping this is the nozzle that proves me wrong about patterned sprayers.",A3C2JQC6R2K52C,5.0,5.0,4.0

It's easy to feel the quality of this nozzle right out of the box.  It's sturdy and made mostly of metal, with a nice grip.  It's comfortable to hold, and easy to squeeze.  When it came in, my husband was doubting it would be as good as the one we have- we have a good one with brass fittings that we've thought was great - but he took it outside and this one is every bit as good - it is easy to turn, click-locks into place for the different settings, sprays exactly the way it should, and does NOT leak.  This one has a more comfortable handle though, and an overall sturdier construction.

The main thing I have to have a nozzle like this for is the fine mist for misting seeds.  This one has one, and it works great, delivering a very fine mist of water that's easy to control the strength of.  The 'jet' setting throws water the most distant and with the most force, and is a good setting for cleaning off a patio or concrete.",A2R1HUYHXV7H18,5.0,5.0,4.0

Unlike most inexpensive spray nozzles, this spray nozzle is made mostly of metal, not plastic. The black and chrome finish looks good, and it features 7 different spray patterns. So far I've used it to wash my car, water my lawn, and clean my concrete patio area. While it doesn't provide the pressure of a power washer, it does a decent job for what it is. It also does not leak like some other cheap nozzles. Priced at around $17, it's a good deal on a quality spray nozzle. The nozzle also comes with a ""12 Months Replacement Warranty; 60 Days Money Back Guarantee"".

That's amusing because we aren't always as careful as we should be when we are finished spraying.
It has hit the cement sidewalk more than a few times, without any damage at all.
The feature that allows it to  stay on without pressing the lever is quite handy when we top off the pool or are doing a lot of spraying. It saves your hands from getting sore. Multiple settings for water sprays.

"Best Facial Cleansing Brush - FYOLA Exfoliation Brush System with 4 Different Modes, Gently Remove Skin Impurities, Microdermabrasion Kit with 2 Attachable Brushing Heads, Rechargeable Portable",5.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this face brush, as I've tried a few of these Clarisonic-like devices before and some have been better than others. This one surprised me. It worked really well. First off, I expected it to be smaller than it is. The last one of the face cleaners I received from another company was half this size, and the advertised price was even more. So just opening the box I was thrilled to find it wasn't another mini version.

Packaged with this Fyola cleaner comes one brush already attached, with a cover on the brush to protect the bristles. Also included is a second brush head, with slightly firmer bristles, and also has a cover on it. There's also a charging cable and a charging stand.

I was pleasantly surprised to find it was a wireless charging device. You just set the Fyola in the stand and it starts charging. Note that it needs to be in the charging stand facing away from you, not towards you like you might expect. You'll know you have it in the right way because the face cleaner will beep at you and the lights for each of the various setting will light up showing it's charging.

When the battery runs low, the Fyola beeps at you to let you know it's needing recharged. There are 4 different cleaning settings, sensitive, pulse life massage, exfoliate and deep clean. And they aren't kidding when they call the 4th setting deep clean. It's a strong setting that works great for getting color-stay foundation makeup out of pours.

There is an included instruction manual but it's so easy to use you really don't need to reference it for much, other than maybe familiarizing yourself with which setting is which.  The Fyola works surprisingly well and is a great full sized face cleaner.

First of all, this is a one size fits most, not all.  I wear an XL in their other products, and this was too tight for me personally.  I was able to wrap it around, but found the tightness of the largest setting uncomfortable.  If you are a larger size, they offer a similar product in XL that might work better for you.

Other than being too snug for long term comfort, this worked very well at supporting my back in just the spots I was hoping it would help.  And it would do a good job of helping me fit back into my skinny jeans, if it weren't for that silly habit I have of needing to breathe. ;)",A1W415JP5WEAJK,4.0,4.0,4.0
Hairika&reg; Hair Straightener Brush Detangling Hair Brush Paddle for Faster and Styling Straightening Anti Static 29w with LCD Screen 110v-240v (Pink),5.0,"The Hairika Hair Straightener paddle brush definitely works at making my wavy or curly hair straight.
The packaging is really nice. It comes in a magnetic closure box with 2 hair clips and a cute light weight black zippered pouch.
My experience with this cool innovative hair straightener was very surprising and pleasant except when I kept holding the paddle a bit higher, then I would burn my hands.
But I learned the hard way to hold it correctly. LOL
My hair sheds a lot too so a lot of hair got in the brush but while it was hot, I was able to lift the hair from the device.
I have wavy hair but I used the Hairika paddle brush on a curly hairstyle I previously had done the day before and as soon as I ran the brush through my hair, I immediately saw my hair getting straightened.
I also realized not just too brush the hair normally but to hold and lift out the hair that needs to be straightened then place the paddle brush straightener on to it.
When I tried the lower various temperatures, it was not getting out the curls but when I switched it to the higher temp of 210 C it flattened my hair and no burn or damage was present.
It gave me a nice smooth and silky finish except not pin straight hair which is ok because I like a little wave on the tips but it did take out the curls as you can see in the pictures below.

Overall, this is a great product. The concept of a rubberized ceramic paddle brush with heat technology and LCD light display with plus or minus temperature buttons is Genius!
And the instructions enclosed are very easy to read and understand.

Hairika&reg; Hair Straightener Brush Detangling Hair Brush Paddle for Faster and Styling Straightening Anti Static 29w with LCD Screen 110v-240v (Pink),4.0,"I have a granddaughter who is always begging me to straighten her hair, but to be completely honest I am scared to use the straightener.  I won't allow her to use it herself, because she is only 9 and I worry she will burn herself.  This is the perfect solution for her and for me.

The straightener itself is designed like a regular hairbrush, however, the bristles that are on it and super hard.  They don't flex like a normal hairbrushes bristles do.  I think that is where the success factor comes in with this.  I was surprised at how easy this is to use.  You simply plug it in, turn it to the temperature you need/want and start brushing your hair.  Easy Peezy!  From the time that I plugged it in to the time it was ready to go was literally just a couple minutes.  The temperature does read in Celsius,  I used it at the highest temperature and it worked great on my granddaughters hair.  I think in another year or so, I would be comfortable allowing her to use this, as opposed to a hot iron.  I would never consider allowing her to use a hot iron before she is in her teens.

"Ceramic Hair Straightener Brush for Straight Hair Styling, Pink",5.0,"This is a great product I didn't know if it was going to work because I use to have very thick curly hair and for some reason now I have thin curly hair and some of the heating product don't work on my hair. Mind you I have 3a to 1b type hair and its very thin.

So I used it and it work good but I can't say that I am going to leave my flat straightener because I can't. As I said it works good on my hair but I still need to pass the flat iron after wards depending how my hair wants to act that day.
My daughter has very thick 3a to 1b as well and it worked good on her hair.

It heats up very nicely, it comes in Celsius degrees only so this is by what the instructions says:
210-230 for fine hair,
210-190 for general hair,
170-190 for soft hair

I went from lowest to 220 to see how my hair would take it. So I suggest for you to play a little with the degrees to see which one suits you the best. It heats up evenly and the tips does not get hot which is nice.

I passed it through the same section about two times and when I finished I brushed the whole hair to even out my style and if my hair did not grasp all I passed my flat iron.

To turn on just press the on/off key and hold for 3 seconds and then do it again to turn off. It also has a heat up and a heat down key which you manage the heat that you want.
This is like a regular flat iron you use it on dry hair only. I also love that it brings a swivel cord and a regular plug because I seen some on you tube and they did not bring a regular plug.
Also it has a one hour auto off function just in case we forget to turn it off which sometimes happens, so I am really glad it has this feature.

Over all I am really liking this product and it is very handy as well very sturdy and can be used anywhere. The shell is made by high-temperature resistant engineering materials,it has anion moisturizing and hydrating care which brings a deep care for your hair and your hair does not smell burnt while using this product. I one big thing is that it cuts off minutes or hours of you straightening your hair so that is a plus.

"Hair Straightener Brush UPGRADED WITH TEMPERATURE LOCK Function, Electric Ceramic LCD Hair Straightening Iron, Detangling Styling Comb",5.0,"I am such a fan of this brush!  I have thick 3C hair and it takes out my curl pattern gently - unlike the harshness of a flat iron. Just a few passes through my hair and it is straight. It straightens my hair in degrees - so if I still want a little wave pattern I only pass it through my hair once. If I want it straighter then I pass it through about 6 times.

I found the best way to use this is to pull my hair taunt and then pass the brush through. Not one has it scorched my hair, but I will say the unit does get hot on the round part - not the handle.

You can change the temperature reading from Celsius to Fahrenheit with the digital display on the handle. There is also a way to lock the temperature on the handle too. This is good since it is easy to accidently turn the brush off while using it since the off/on button is on the handle too.

The only thing I do not like about this brush is that it is a Chinese product, so the writing on the brush is Chinese. I hope they market a version to those that read English. This in no way takes away from how well the product works,

Elbahya Organic Moisturizing Bar Soap with Argan for Face and Body. Fragrance Free for All Skin Types. 2.82 Oz,5.0,"This is such a great natural moisturizing bar soap! We have a larger sized family with 7 members, and 5 out of our 7 have some form of eczema. Each member that has it, has a different form, meaning everyone has to have a different kind of cream and soap to use so that they don't have as many flair ups. That can get pretty pricey! My 9 yo daughter alone cream is $22 a tub, and the others are not far behind that!

We have been using this Elbahya Organic Moisturizing Agran Oil Soap for near, a week, and I have been using it on everyone to be able to, compare the differences and the longer it goes that we are bathing with this Elbahya Organic Moisturizing Agran Oil Soap I don't have to apply their creams as much! Some nights i donrlt have to apply it at all! Here is what i have been doing...each night I bath the kids, and instead of ApplYing their creams right away, I wait until it is time for bed, when I lay them down I check them, if they have any kind of patches or places that are looking a little more rough than others I apply their cream. If they don't have any signs, I don't and check again in the morning. Within the week that we have been using this soap, I would say that our cream usage has been cut in half! I will update this later as I think by the time that,we finish this bar, we may be down to no creams! And that would be awesome, by saving time an money!

These are a little on the small side for full nail wraps. They are long enough for my not-too-long nails, but the widest of each pattern isn't quite wide enough to cover my thumbnails from side to side.

Electronic Nail Care System - Manicure Pedicure - Toe and Finger Nail Care - File Buff &amp; Shine - Electric Nail File Set - Perfect Salon Finish - Strong Healthy and Shiny Nails in 3 Simple Steps,4.0,"This Electronic Nail Care System is very easy to use and is good for a home kit! This nail care system comes with a file(blue), buffer(green), and shine(white) attachments that easily fit onto the device. This nail care system does run off of one AA battery which is not included and the battery compartment is at the very bottom of the device. This system does have some sound to it but it's not overly loud or annoying. The file works really well and for me personally does a better job than when I use emery boards. The buffer doesn't show too much of a difference but it does better than others that I've used previously. The shine does give my nails some shine; it's not drastic but my nails are more shinier than they were before. Overall I really like this system as it does make some difference to my nails and I'm not expert in healthy nails! I would recommend this Electronic Nail Care System!

Electronic Nail Care System - Manicure Pedicure - Toe and Finger Nail Care - File Buff &amp; Shine - Electric Nail File Set - Perfect Salon Finish - Strong Healthy and Shiny Nails in 3 Simple Steps,1.0,"Rating: 1.5 stars
Pros:
+ Low price
+ Mild abrasion
+ Runs on cheap AA batteries
Cons:
 - No storage case to keep everything together
 - Much slower than manual filing
 - Cheap construction
 - Feels like it could break at any time
 - No replacement files
My wife and I had such high hopes for this electric file.  We cut one of our 13 month old son's nails a little too close a few months ago and ever since that happened, he's terrified when we clip his nails.. Kicking, screaming, crying, and the problem is his nails grow at warp speed so once a week clipping is a must.  The good thing about this product is that he's not afraid of the gentle filing action.  But it feels like it could break any second.  The plastic doesn't feel solid.  The file head wobbles around like it might fly off with a gust of wind, and the on/ off bottom is junky.  Plus it comes with one set of files and then it's apparantly disposable so even at this great price, you're better off buying anything else

Born Pretty Fan Brush Professional Single Soft Makeup Brush Face Foundation/Powder Brush Make Up Tool,5.0,"I got this natural bristle fan brush for $1.58, an unbelievable price.  Yes, it came from China, where the value of the US dollar must be huge.  I washed it before using it, simply because I wanted to, not that it had a strange odor or anything like that.  This brush is a bit large for close work but for applying highlighter powder to the top of my cheekbones, it works perfectly.  I ordered another one prior to receiving this one but when the package came, I accidentally cut off half the bristles.  I think I paid about $4 for that one but when I went to reorder it, the price had gone down by more than half.  I have a lot of very expensive brushes so I was pleasantly surprised at the nice quality of this brush.  I wasn't looking for anything fancy and this brush does the job beautifully.  It picks up just the right amount of powder and once I tap off the excess, the exact amount is left on the bristles.  It also washes nicely with baby shampoo.  It also doesn't shed at all, which is weird for such an inexpensive brush.  I look forward to using it regularly.  If you need a medium size fan brush, this is a great one and a real steal.  However, shipping does take quite a while.  I definitely recommend this brush.",A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX,5.0,5.0,4.0

EDITED TO ADD: These really looked great and with a topcoat they lasted five days and would have gone longer, but the polish on my other nails was chipping so I re-did my manicure. For what it's worth, even with the glitter these came off quite easily with acetone based nail polish remover.",A1VUXNNB1NJ2PT,5.0,5.0,4.0
Hair Straightener Professional Detangling Hair Brush Hair Styling Comb Digital Anti Static Anti-Scald Ceramic Heating Iron Pink Hair Massage Straightening Irons (Black Red),4.0,"I was impressed that the Prettyqueen Professional Hair Straightening Brush actually did work.  I decided to do one side of my hair to show the difference in the attached photo.  I do have thick hair so I have to divide my hair in order to get to the hair underneath.  I was impressed how the brush glided through my hair smoothly without tangling or hesitation.  It left my hair silky and shiny - that is the ceramic icons at work!

The only features I did not care for is being unable to change the temperature readout from Celsius to Fahrenheit and not being able to lock the temperature setting.  My fingers repeatedly touched the buttons and would lower and sometimes turn off the brush.

The brush does get extremely hot so I strongly recommend using a heat styling glove.  I would probably use the brush for touch-ups, but will continue to use my flat iron to completely straighten my hair since it is just a time consuming if not, maybe even takes up more time since you have to go over your hair repetitively to achieve a pin straight result.

Face Moisturizer for Dry Skin by WONDERPIEL for Men and Women - 100% Natural 70% Organic,4.0,"Natural Skin Moisturizer by Wonderpiel is a good product used in conjunction with the Vitamin Serum. It can be used for either oily or dry skin plus can be used not just on the face but all over where you have dry skin. The only thing I did not like about it was the smell. It is very medicinal and it seems to last awhile. Otherwise, this moisturizer made my skin feel soft, not tight as some moisturizers tend to do. I live in northern Wisconsin and winters can get pretty harsh so a good moisturizer is a must.

Face Moisturizer for Dry Skin by WONDERPIEL for Men and Women - 100% Natural 70% Organic,5.0,"It is hard to find a moisturizer with skin healthy ingredients and suitable for my skin type. I enjoy this product immensely because it leaves me skin moisturized without the heavy residue most intense moisturizers do. After two straight weeks of using this moisturizer, I have concluded that it works every bit as well, or better than the name brands I have been paying more money for at the department store. This moisturizer leaves my skin comfortable, soft, and matte all day long. The scent is delightful in my opinion and I find myself terribly addicted to the wonderful aroma. Even though it feels light on the skin, it helps my makeup glide on smoothly with absolute moisture. It feels like it disappears as soon as it is rubbed in, and yet it keeps my skin perfectly balanced and moisturized all day without the shiny greasy looking. I especially need something to help my sensitive skin stay hydrated and soft. This moisturizer seems to have just the right formula for that purpose without causing any breakouts.

This facial moisturizer is rich and creamy. I really appreciate that this product is not greasy or sticky. When using this moisturizer, I can actually feel it sink into my skin pretty fast. It instantly makes my face feel very smooth and it soaks in rather quickly without leaving any uncomfortable residues. I have been using this cream twice a day and always making sure to cover my eyelids as well. It is so gentle for my sensitive skin that my skin does not itch or turn red. It is not greasy, but the coverage is thick enough to sufficiently provide moisture for night time. I do not like oily or sticky moisturizers, but I do prefer certain degree of a good moisturizing coverage. This is a very good face cream compared to many other brands of moisturizers that I have used not to mention the fact that it is made by skin healthy ingredients and botanical extracts.

I have only been using it for two weeks and I have noticed that my skin is starting to feel smoother and firmer. However, there has not been much difference in my fine lines yet, but I strongly believe it will further benefit my skin with consistent use. The tone of my skin also seems to be improving and I could not be more happier. This is a good facial moisturizer that I find perfect for my skin type during the day since it has helped my makeup look natural and smoother. I will definitely recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin looking for a good face cream to provide adequate moisture and combat signs of aging.

Disclosure: I purchased this facial moisturizer at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.",A2XZM64TLWL34O,4.5,5.0,4.0

RubyLux Amber Yellow LED Bulb Size Small,5.0,"Amber light therapy is also sometimes referred to as yellow or orange light therapy. It encompasses the range of wavelengths from 570 nm to 620 nm.

How Does It Work & What Is It Good For:
Amber light has quite a shallow skin penetration but is effective in the treatment of skin issues involving redness, such as spider veins. Though it is not typically used for tissue healing or collagen/elastin production, where it excels is in the treatment of problems such as sun damage. It is often considered to be an ideal therapy for sensitive skin, as its therapy is calming and soothing. Amber light therapy is frequently recommended as a drug free alternative treatment for skin redness and flushing, irritation, rosacea, UV radiation damage, and reducing the appearance of the tiny blood vessels on the nose and face. It helps to flush waste from the skin, boost lymphatic flow, and increase cellular growth. Orange light returns a vitality to skin that has lost its sheen. Especially recommended for wedding days and portraits, orange light works on dull complexions to bring out a brilliant healthy glow.

How Often Should I Use It:
4 to 6 times a week for the first 2 to 3 weeks, then at least 3 times a week for at least 3 months. The more and longer you use it the better results you will get.

Benefits of amber light:
Improvements you can see  amber light therapy reduces redness, evens out the complexion and calms irritated skin. When used regularly, this means visible, ongoing benefits for many rosacea sufferers.
Benefits that start working fast  no rosacea treatment is immediate, but many users of amber light therapy for rosacea find that this treatment works faster and more consistently than most other products they have ever tried.
Quick and easy treatments  treating the entire face can be as fast as 4.5 minutes per day.
Side effect-free  when LED amber light therapy is used according to the product directions, there are no known side effects linked to its regular use.
Portable  both the bulb and the clamp light (sold separately) are light, small and durable so that you won't have to skip out on treatments just because you won't be at home. Toss them in a tote, suitcase or even a decent-sized handbag. The bulb when used according to the directions, should last a lifetime! This purchase is the only investment youll ever need to make into amber light therapy for rosacea.",A3I1AUNT38MLJ2,5.0,5.0,4.0

Kangaroo Banana Powder - BEST Banana Setting Powder in the World - Hi-Def OIL FREE,3.0,"I was looking forward to trying this product as I have heard good things about banana powder. I have very sensitive skin, and the main ingredient of this product is talc. Talc is a filler in most makeups and is known to clog pores. As a daily powder to set my makeup, this banana powder does not work for me..

However, if you do not have sensitive skin and would be using this product for only a short time, it might work for you. If you are dressing up for a play or for Halloween or a costume party, this would probably be fine. Unfortunately, my skin can't handle talc, so I can't recommend this product based on my experiences with talc.

Tinksky Nail Art Stamping Printing Plate Manicure Stamping Image Plate Templates with Stamp Pack of 10 (Silver),4.0,"These stamping plates are not the best quality in the areas of fine detail, but they are not the worst either.  I used many different stampers and the firm stamper it comes with really worked the best.  You can see this on the swatch sheet I did; the two boxed in areas were done with the stamper that came with it.  I was pretty shocked it worked so well and did not need priming.  So, I'm quite happy to add this stamper to my collection.  The white stamper shown is the Uber Chic XL Non-Sticky stamper that usually picks up everything in great detail.
I tried using these plates with Wet N Wild black first, and not stamping polish, to see how well the images picked up.  The detail did pick up well but I found that some of the plates had large areas that were etched next to really find detail areas so sometimes the card would get stuck.  The metal scraper that came with the set was not helpful at all.  It is metal and as I feared completely scratched the plate and got stuck in some of the large areas I mentioned.  I just used a gift card like scraper and got better results.
This is also not a set from one manufacturer.  It appears its a hodge podge of collection of plates and my set had a duplicate which is pictured below.  Also, one plate was rusted under the blue film.  I have not contacted the manufacturer about this.
I tried to go for the finest details on each plate for the swatch and for the life of me I could not get the suckers from the octopus to all come out.  The blue portion of the swatch is Mundo de Unas stamping polish which did not even make that portion better.
Most of these plates stamped well though, you can see this on the swatch image.  I was impressed that I was able to get the watermelon seeds with regular nail polish.  I was however really dissapoined that one was damaged and I only received 9 distinct plates.

Lectric Shave Pre-Shave Original 3 oz,3.0,"I have been using this product for as long as I have been shaving. It does seem to help me get a closer shave and helps prevent razor burn and irritation.
The smell is terrible, however. You will want to be sure to wash it off your face after shaving.
The stubble that collects in my shaver also seems to clump and stick more with this product, which requires a little more cleaning of the shaver.
You should also wash your hands very well after applying it. If not, it will permanently stain/discolor your hand towels.
I also noticed that the plastic shelf in my medicine cabinet has melted in the area where I keep the Lectric Shave. I think some drips down the side of the bottle after I apply it, which melted the plastic.

Lectric Shave Pre-Shave Original 3 oz,3.0,"I recently started using an electric razor after years of being a supporter of the wet shave market.  Mostly for times when it's convenient and I am in a hurry.  I remember years ago when I used an electric shaver that this Williams lectric shave worked well in making a difference in a close shave.  Picking up a bottle after all these years proves that it still does, and in my opinion a pre shave lotion is a good investment for electric razor users.  That being said, I have to say that somewhere along the line Williams changed their formula somewhat, at least in the scent, for its not the same as I remember to be sure.  Years ago this pre shave smelled as nice as any after shave did.  It was a pleasant but not too strong barber shop sort of spice scent. Now it seems to have a very weak but not at all likable scent that despite its lack of strength still seems to linger on after you shave, even with a rinse.  It reminds me very much of those cheap after shave rip offs you can find in some dollar stores that go on smelling nice for a few minutes, but then quickly turn sour and cheap...  As good as this works at stimulating your beard with a splash of alcohol and other ingredients, my recommendation is to use Afta brand pre shave which I picked up at a local pharmacy, but is also readily available here on Amazon in a two pack at the time of this writing.  In fact I have ordered some here simply because Afta's availability locally is spotty at best.  Williams seems to have a marketing hold in my neck of the woods because its also easy to find.  But I still recommend this only if you don't have any Afta available.  Afta smells much better, works as well if not better than the Willians, and unlike the Williams, to my knowledge has always been the same formula....&nbsp;Mennen Afta Pre-Electric original 3 FL OZ (PACK OF 2)",A35W3JQYP0M655,4.405405405405405,3.0,4.0
Lectric Shave Pre-Shave Original 3 oz,3.0,"I just recently started shaving again with an electric razor after 40 years of blades. I bought the&nbsp;Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue&nbsp;and absolutely love it. Today's razors are so much better than years ago.

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor.

Lectric Shave Pre-Shave Original 3 oz,5.0,"This liquid is well formulated to cause facial hair to slightly stand out in readiness for an electric shave. There are also ingedients in ""Williams Lectric Shave"" that have a soothing and medicinal effect on the face, and greatly reduce the irritation that would accrue from a raw shave. Skin irritation, the probability of ingrown hairs, and emergence of acne pimples is all reduced. The lotion allows for a closer, smoother, comfortable shave. I have tried several other pre-shaving lotions, but I have ended up sticking to ""Williams"" for very many years. But you should also consider that skin texture and vulnerability varies from person to person. A skin product that irritates one person may be wonderful for another.",A245FDGAV2C3KW,4.405405405405405,5.0,4.0
Lectric Shave Pre-Shave Original 3 oz,4.0,"I shave with an electric razor because my skin is very sensitive. An electric razor is great at avoiding irritation and this is a boost. My neck is the most sensitive area and I sometimes get irritated, but with this product I don't get it as bad. It leaves something like an oil on your face that allows the razor to glide better and it does help the razor catch hair easier. Also, it makes shaving a little bit faster.

However, I am giving this product 4 stars because it doesn't help me get a closer shave as it claims. When you use an electric razor you are supposed to stretch your skin a little bit to stand up the hairs so you can get close and I can do that much better and get closer when shaving dry. I will keep using this product because it helps my sensitive skin but wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for something to get much closer.",A2UHXPMDDHRFC9,4.405405405405405,4.0,4.0

This rivals the high-end one I purchased from Lancome a few months ago. The product came boxed with the ingredients listed. You're also getting a sealed refill cushion compact included in the box which is amazing for the price. The compact is made of a high quality white plastic. It's easy to open using a push button in the front. There's a good size mirror in the upper lid and a hinged plastic cover to prevent the cushion from drying out. You can hear a soft click when it's closed, so you know it's not going to open inadvertently. There's a Myconos branded applicator that rests on top of the cover.

The foundation I got (#2) works well with my NC20-25 skin. It's not a heavy foundation. I would consider it moderate coverage at best. It's very blendable and like most cushion compacts, feels very light on the skin. I included a picture which shows a heavy application on my cheek blended out towards the front of my face. Wear is very good. I haven't felt the need to reapply after using it in the morning. Like a lot of Korean cosmetics, the quality and cutting edge technology used is amazing.

I remember being so excited to try one of these hair brush straighteners when they first came out but, I am over that now it does straighten it somewhat but, not like a flat iron.

Nothing miraculous and not super perfume-y, but they do add a little something special to tub time.

If I had to complain I would say that a little doesn't go a long way and with a bottle this small don't expect to get a lot of uses out of it. Also, the 'rocks' are very hard so it takes them a while to dissolve. I would let them soak for a bit before stepping in the tub to prevent sharp pain.

Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Bath &amp; Shower Gel,3.0,"I love Pre de Provence soaps, in part because they are powerfully, yet pleasantly fragrant. My bathroom often smells like a spa. Here, the description was not kidding when it noted that these dried lavender blossoms provide a ""subtle"" scent. It's so subtle, I basically have to put my nose within inches of it to smell anything at all.  I've always enjoyed the scent of lavender, and with a busy household I had hoped to use this as a potpourri to improve various mystery smells that can occur in a home with two kids. Unfortunately, it didn't work the way I had hoped.  While the dried blossoms are amusing to play with, as dried herbs often are, they are not exactly pretty compared to flower petal potpourri. It's also sad that the bag is not designed to be resealed. If you're careful you may be able to use the original sticky seal, but you have to be very careful opening and closing the bag. For all of these reasons, but especially the lack of smell, I'm afraid this is one Pre de Provence product I am not able to recommend.",A39H1GO9E3YQIB,4.088888888888889,3.0,4.0
Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Bath &amp; Shower Gel,4.0,"Honestly, there have not been a whole lot of products that I have seen on the store shelves that have shown to have the best care for beauty, whether it is store brands or name brands overall. But I have lately been trying some exquisite brands of beauty products that have shown to be enriching & full of life in regards to care. Overall, some of them haven't worked very well, but other products have surprised me. There has been a European brand that I have recently been trying products from called Pre' de Provence. Honestly, I have been very surprised about how enriching their skin care bath care products have been. Lately, I have recently tried some of their body lotion with a lavender scent & honestly it felt very luxurious. The lotion brings in a better sense of moisture & quality in my chapped skin all over my body. While it does cost more than what you would get in other places, it still does a better job for the money. I would suggest that you do give this lotion a try. It might be small, but carries a lot of beauty in product.

Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Bath &amp; Shower Gel,5.0,"Note: At the time of this review, seven different products are being sold on the same page. I am reviewing the lavendar lavender blossoms.

This is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

When you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

If there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it.",A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,4.088888888888889,5.0,4.0

Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Bath &amp; Shower Gel,2.0,"I use essential oils frequently in atomizers, on damp cloths near fans, and even as an additive in homemade cleaners. What I've found is that lavender scents can be tricky. Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent. It does not come with a spray attachment.

Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Bath &amp; Shower Gel,3.0,"I buy a lot of lavender to use in everything from sachets to lemonade. I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms.",A33PVCHCQ2BTN0,4.088888888888889,3.0,4.0

Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Bath &amp; Shower Gel,5.0,"Dried Lavender Blossoms? Amazing! If I had known that you could buy these, I would have purchased them a long time ago. We love the smell of lavender in our house. It is probably the top scent that we buy in all candles, waxes, etc. My original plan was to use this like potpourri. When the bag arrived and we smelled it, we had the brilliant idea to put it in our scent warmer (ceramic warmer that is warmed by an electronic light). It worked out so well! Our house smells like lavender and it is amazing.

These dried lavender blossoms are very potent too. We only used about half a handful. So, we still have almost the entire bag to use for later. It will last for a long time. These would also be great for making clothing bags. If you place a little bit in a cheesecloth type bag and place it in your drawers, it makes your drawer and the items inside smell incredible.

The Pre De Provence lavender spray smells fabulous. Not the least bit musty, which some lavender sprays can get a bit of a musty undertone, not this one.

I iron clothes inside out if I'm going to use any spray, and a light spritz left a wonderful fragrance, not overwhelming, and didn't stain my clothes.

One thing that was odd about this is the lid was on rather loosely with no safety seal.  Some of the product had leaked into its inner shipping poly bag.  Perhaps a safety seal would eliminate this from happening as well as add a modicum of safety.

"RUIMIO Makeup Brush 10-Piece Foundation Brush for Makeup Application, Blending, Highlighting and Contouring",5.0,"This makeup brush set includes a broad range of 10 brushes that are suitable for makeup professionals as well as home makeup application.  Each one is made from high-density synthetic hair and are engineered for the perfect combination of softness and firmness.  They are optimized for holding, applying and blending fine cosmetics.  The ends are dyed blue for a unique look.  The set features rounded, angled, tapered and flat brushes so there's one for every purpose and product from applying foundation to blush to eyeshadow and more.  They work with all forms of product including powders, creams and liquids.  Now you'll always have the right brush for every facial area, for each application technique and every type of product.  The black wooden handles are ergonomically designed for optimal comfort.

Whether you are an old hand at applying your makeup or just beginning, it doesn't matter if you use designer brand makeup or drugstore brand cosmetics, if you don't have quality application tools, then you're ultimately just wasting your money.  Granted, when it comes to makeup brush sets, the possibilities could be endless, however in actuality you only need 7 specific brushes.  This kit has everything you would possibly need.  Although some experts say to buy your brushes a la carte, I prefer to buy them as a set so that you know you're getting the same quality with each brush type.

Whether you choose synthetic or natural hair bristles is a matter of personal preference.  I know I've mentioned this before, but I personally have two sets of brushes.  One set is natural and the other is synthetic and I enjoy each one for different reasons.  However, when all is said and done, I have found that my synthetic brushes are more durable and stand up better to regular cleaning.  The synthetic bristles don't trap product nor do they absorb pigments, so your colors are less likely to run together when using highly pigmented cosmetics such as eyeshadow or blush.

Now, I'm not going to even try to say that this affordable set of brushes are better than designer brands because quite frankly they aren't better.  However, I will say that they work just as well as my more expensive brushes do.  They are comfortable to use and they come in a very travel friendly case.  I like to keep this set in my 'Go Bag' so that I always have the right brushes available when I'm not at home.  There's no need to pack my 30+ brush sets when all I really need are the 10 brushes in this set.

This brush set includes one of each of the following brushes:  precision round brush for eyeshadow and eye primer, angled contour brush for blush and bronzer, small flat brush for stipple concealer application, small angled brush for contouring cheeks and side of your nose, small flat angled brush for applying concealer around your eyes, tapered contouring brush for harder to reach areas, angled blending brush for cheekbones and nose, flat blending brush for liquid and cream products, round powder brush for blending powder products and a small tapered brush for concealer application on hard to reach areas.  That makes this the perfect travel or starter kit for all occasions.

The best part is that these quality brushes won't shed their bristles or lose their colorant and they are completely odor-free.  Add that to their 100% money back guarantee and you have the perfect set of brushes to get the perfect look you desire.  I highly recommend them for every application skill level.

I bought this brush set with my own money, at a discount, in exchange for a candid review, and given the amount of makeup and makeup brushes I own, I think I'm a pretty good candidate to review this item!

What I Liked:
---It's every bit as pretty as the product image.  The brushes are an aqua-greenish-blue tone with matte black branded handles.
---The brushes are cut fairly well.  So where there are supposed to be rounded angles, the curves are fairly smooth (except for several of the skinny brushes.)
---On the wider brushes, the density is quite good.  If the brush is too sparse, it takes too long to cover your face with foundation.
---The brush hairs are pretty soft.  Not quite as soft as the Urban Decay Good Karma brush, but certainly softer than Bare Minerals brushes, if that helps.

What Could Be Better:
---The handles are longer than they need to be, especially on the skinny brushes.  I don't know why they had to make those so long.
---The handles are branded, but not imprinted with the brush function.  So you just have to figure out what each brush is for.  I've been wearing makeup for 2 decades, and I'd be lying if I said I automatically knew what each brush was for.  I particularly had trouble figuring out what the skinny angled brush and skinny flat top brush are for.  The flat top is a complete mystery to me.
---Given the size of that brush roll, they might as well have included a simple zip pocket.  There's plenty of space for it.

What Doesn't Bother Me At All:
---There's already been some shedding, although that's to be expected.
---The brush roll *is* synthetic, and when you first open it up, it smells like vinyl/pleather/polyurethane, etc.  But it *does* dissipate.  It doesn't stay like that forever.  Maybe some people are just more sensitive, I guess?

I think this is a great set for the price, and part of the charm is the color.  Yes, that may be a stupid reason, but I think there are plenty of people who'll agree anyway.  Will this brush set replace my ridiculously expensive Marc Jacobs foundation brushes?  No.  But that's why you splurge on one top quality foundation brush that lasts forever, and then save some cash when it comes to your blush and highlighter brushes, where you can afford to be a little imprecise.  The skinnier brushes are slightly less useful to me, but on the other hand there have been plenty of times when I just need a clean eyeshadow blending brush, and have a couple of spares on hand means I don't have to stop everything to cleanse my shadow brush on the spot.  I don't have any trouble recommending this set to anyone--it's cute and functional.  So what if its not heirloom quality?",A3TWPW6C78JPGV,5.0,5.0,4.0

Opshorie Electric Hair Straightener Brush Elegant Hair Straightening Styling Detangling Brush for Natural Look Silky Hair Anti Scald Anti Static Ceramic Heating Anion Treatment,5.0,"This is the BEST hair brush straightener! I can't believe how amazing this entire set is!
Before I owned four hair straighteners from four different brands, and I wasn't happy with any one of them. Those straighteners I had really damaged my hair to the point I never ever wanted to use a hair straightener again in my life! I suffered from split ends, damaged cuticles, lack of shine on my hair. That's why I stopped using heat on my hair. Not even a hair dryer!
I mean I literally dumped everything that caused my hair to damage, and switched all of my shampoos, conditioners to a more natural less harmful alternatives. However, no matter what I do, it didn't help with my ""dead hair"", so I recently had my hair cut short. And because of that, my hair has become a lot healthier!  Although, something else became a problem since I cut my hair short, whenever it touches my shoulder, my hair flips and curls! I didn't like the way it looked, so I had to consider buying a straighter again... So I went online, and I found this Opshorie Hair Straightener Brush. I was hooked from the moment I saw this, and this has quickly become my new absolute favorite straightener!
It's a brush and a straightener! How amazing is this?! I never ever had such a great experience with these tools. But I'm so glad I gave this guy a try, because my hair isn't damaged at all even after using it twenty times! I love this thing! You won't regret buying this set!

My review is still my honest opinion of this hair brush hair straightener. I love that it comes with a glove to prevent you from burning yourself. I really love the hair brush that come with the hair straightener. The clips were really useful since I have a ton of hair. It makes it easier to straighten, if you divid your hair in to small and thin sections. Before you use this item make sure to brush your hair, so that it is easier to use. This straightening brush is still a hair straightener, so remember to use heat protectors on your hair. Invest in a good hair protector for your hair type. I have a ton of hair so the brush works better when I section my hair in to small sections. I really liked this product for my hair type. After I use this product, I put oil in my hair, so that some of the moisture can return. I also do hair masks and use hair repair shampoos, so I can avoid damaging my hair.

I have been using Valentia Clear Lift Revitalizing Serum  for about three weeks. I put it on at night after my cleansing routine and before bed. After using it for several weeks, I did notice that my face was not so dry and seemed to feel healthier. Winters in northern Wisconsin can be pretty harsh on the face.  I used about 3-4 pumps and put it on my face and neck, the serum dries fast and smells really nice, not overpowering but nice. I have used several different products from Valentia and have not been disappointed yet. One of the ingredients is Argan oil, which I love for body and hair, the Gotu Kola which reduces the appearance of scars, and one that I never thought of is Licorice which can lighten problem areas of the skin such as discolorization.

A little bit of this serum goes a long way. I love how this makes my face feel and it still feels smooth when I get up in the morning. I really like it.

"Beautonics Advanced Hair Straightening Brush - New 2016 - Safest Anti Scald, Anti Static Protection - Most Effective And Rapid Heating, Styling - Massage Irons, Detangling Brush Straightener - Gold",5.0,"loving this hair straightener! I have another one that I have used about two to three times because it takes longer then the regular hair straightener so I have it in case of a emergency. My daughter tried the other one and did not like it but we used this one and it worked great and fast.
I should let you know that my daughter was in beauty school and they had her like a puppet doing stuff to her hair and so she got really bad heat damage that all her curls were gone. But I have been putting coconut and argan oil so it can recuperate and its been about 6 months and several hair cuts. Now her hair is better and you will see on the photos.

This is a great product it does heat up fast which is great. I first combed her hair then I passed the straightener about twice on the same hair and we loved that her hair did not smell burnt and it grabbed great on the hair.
She has really thick curly hair so I had to do sections by section but it took about 15 to 30 minutes when she takes about 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours with a regular straightener.

Overall we do love this straightener and will continue using it. I also like that it has a shut off if you forget to shut it off and  the brush is ceramic and uses PTC for its heating.

The bottle says 7 minutes, but i left mine on for 5, as it was the first time using. I have tried so many different mask and i cant believe the results after one use. Its very inexpensive but works better than many masks triple the price. I just could not get over how soft and smooth it left my skin.

essie Spring 2016 Collection Nail Polish,4.0,"I'm not the world's biggest fan of Essie polishes, but apparently Essie's corporate heads have been listening to complaints. Two of the polishes I received from their Spring 2016 collection were the usual soft pastels you'd expect. The big change is that they were wonderfully opaque in just two coats.
pretty pinky
That's a new one for Essie. I tried both High Class Affair, a nice nude, and Lounge Lover, a pretty light to medium toned pinky coral. High Class Affair was the big surprise. It was opaque in two medium coats, and the color was well saturated with no visible nail lines. Lounge Lover was similarly full coverage in the same number of coats.

Both lasted five days without chips, which is about average for an Essie. The Spring 2016 collection may not be wowing anybody in terms of daring new colors, but at least Essie did pretty neutrals pretty well, and that's a huge improvement.",A2JCJJNY43QQIV,4.2,4.0,4.0
essie Spring 2016 Collection Nail Polish,4.0,"The color is a bit different than shown in the picture - much more pink than orange. A nice coral color. I really like it.

I've tried Essie nail polish before and have no complaints. I really enjoy this new color for spring.",A24ZMNWTW8AQUR,4.2,4.0,4.0
essie Spring 2016 Collection Nail Polish,5.0,"I've always loved Essie polish (Playdate, In the Cab-ana and Avenue Maintain are three of my go to colors and I also really like their base coats) because I find them easy to apply and, as long as I use a base and top coat, long-lasting for a non-gel polish. Accordingly I was really excited to try out Off Tropic from the Spring 2016 collection, particularly because I don't have a lot of greens in my polish collection. In person, I found this to be a bit darker than I was expecting, especially given it's intended as a summer polish.  It's hard to accurately pin down the color.  It's a very deep green that is almost evergreen to me, but with a bit more blue. To me it also has that 'classic' nail polish finish.  While I will admit this isn't a color I would have probably picked out on my own I've warmed up to it the more I've worn it and it's definitely very different from anything else in my collection.

Experience-wise, I liked applying this. I found it to be consistent with my previous experience applying Essie polish. I know some people find it to be on the thin side, but I personally find it makes this easier to apply. I like the thickness of this polish much better than Julep, which I find to be thicker and a little unruly at times. It's also deeply pigmented.  So much so that it seemed like I could have almost gotten away with a single coat, though I prefer two.  That said, it isn't 5-free (though it is DBP, Toluene and Formaldehyde free) so if that is important to you, you'll want to go with a different nail polish brand, but I've never had any adverse reactions to Essie.

In short, if this shade is up your alley it's a fun, user-friendly polish.",AHN86VFJIJ2JP,4.2,5.0,4.0

"Sol De Janeiro Brazilian Crush Body Fragrance Mist, 3.04 Ounce",3.0,"Y'all need new noses or something.
While the scent for this mist is decent and works nicely with the Bum Bum Cream, I'm not sure where you're getting this beach smell, and more importantly, the scent fails to last. The cream on its own is what carries the scent -- with or without the fragrance mist, the cream's scent is strong. The mist adds a nice whiff initially but that's about it.

Frankly, there are way too many nice body mists to try out for me to buy this again, but if you're religious about Bum Bum Cream, then I suggest you stay with this because the fragrance in the cream is such that it won't really meld with many other perfumes.

I'm enjoying using the BBC and this mist, generally speaking, but neither product is really worth the price tag. I have many other bottles of products that work as well, if not better, for a fraction of the cost, or even double the cost with staying power.",A1JDBXPK20HBUW,3.5,3.0,4.0

Pure Body Naturals Eye Cream for Dark Circles and Puffiness &ndash; 1.7 fl oz,5.0,"I've been using this Eye Gel for 3 weeks now and I have to say so far I love it! The first night that used it I put a little too much, a little definately goes a long way with this. The texture is a thicker cream with a slight whipped fluffiness to it, its not completely whipped, but it is there. I put onto my eyes and there was no sticky feel, which I do not like sticky on my face or body for that ,matter,  anywhere!

One plus that I love with this Pure Body Naturals Eye Cream Eye Gel is that it didn't burn my eyes. I guess I have sensitive eyes and lots of moisturizers and creams burn my eyes so bad, and this one doesn't.

I haven't been using this cream long enough to say anything about long term results, but let me tell you, when I woke up the next morning my under eye wrinkle creases were barely visible!

"Coconut Oil Hair Mask - Deep Conditioner with 100% Cold pressed Coconut, Argan, Rosehip oil &amp; Shea Butter - Repair and Moisturize Dry, damaged or Color Treated hair - for all hair types 8 Oz",5.0,"I have a variety of Radha products, ranging from beauty to home/bath products, and my experience has sometimes been a little hit or miss.  (Big hit = Cool Mist Diffuser.  Big miss = Cellulite Cream.) So I was slightly apprehensive when I was offered this product for free in exchange for a candid review, especially since I'm a scientist, and I'm tough when it comes to grading.  But this one earns 5 stars, for the simple face that it does what I need it to do, which is condition and soften my hair in way that leaves it shiny and un-frizzy.

For reference I have waist-length, healthy hair---each hair is very fine, but I have a billion of them, and they easily blow around my face in breeze because they're so lightweight.  So I want something that weighs my hair down, which I admit is probably not what most people are aiming for; but in order for my hair to hang nicely in a shiny sheet, it needs the right kind of moisture coating to temporarily smooth the cuticle and allow it to drape properly.

This conditioner is pretty rich---and it does smell like coconuts, but only faintly, which is fine with me.  I have to use quite a lot (like a handful) so this jar isn't going to last long, but then again, I have hair to my waist.  FYI:  this is not an instant conditioner.  It definitely needs a few minutes to work.  I didn't get out of the shower or anything (Who's patient enough to take a two-part shower in order to do a lengthy hair mask? Am I right?) but I did leave to sit in my hair for 4 minutes while I shaved my legs!  The good news is that it *does* leave your hair shiny.  I wouldn't say it leaves my hair softer than a drugstore brand, but I can get a brush through it pretty easily.

Now for the bad news.  I compare the ingredients of EVERY beauty and bath product I use against databases of comedogenicity (i.e. how easily these ingredients cause breakouts.)  This is because I live in San Francisco, where the water is very hard, and the dissolved minerals combine with skin oils, and comedogenic ingredients to form an invisible pore-clogging soap scum.  So I do my homework (and it's exhausting.......)  If you have acne-prone skin, let me share the findings so you don't have to do as much work as I did.  The online database acnemantra.com returned the following results:
----------
Found 4 acne causing ingredients:
Shea Butter is comedogenic
Argan Oil is comedogenic
Rosehip Seed Oil is mildly comedogenic
Coconut Oil is highly comedogenic
- See more at (...)
----------
If you're surprised to see coconut oil on that list, well...it's true.  Coconut oil is highly comedogenic and will cause breakouts if you have large pores that block at the drop of a hat.  I know some people rave about it, but they probably have dry skin and small pores.  The rest of us need to be very careful, because even a single comedogenic ingredient can spell disaster.  This one has four of them.  So you might be playing with fire.  It just depends what type of skin you have.  I think this is a good conditioner--I just need to be very careful to rinse twice, and not let any residue stay on my scalp, face, or body.  If you don't have acne-prone skin--then this is an even better fit for you. (you lucky devils.)",A3TWPW6C78JPGV,4.833333333333333,5.0,4.0
"Coconut Oil Hair Mask - Deep Conditioner with 100% Cold pressed Coconut, Argan, Rosehip oil &amp; Shea Butter - Repair and Moisturize Dry, damaged or Color Treated hair - for all hair types 8 Oz",4.0,"This is a good and nourishing hair mask. If I use it more than once a week, my hair starts to look a little greasy, but if I use it once every 10 days, I get a nice sheen of hair with no greasy look whatsoever. The product comes in a plastic tub about the size of a 12 oz tub of butter. Each time I use the product, I use about 2 tablespoons specifically focusing on the ends of my hair. I have super long hair, almost 42 inches long! It reaches past my hips to my glutes. I focus on the hair at my shoulders and all the way down. I have split ends that need to be trimmed, but this is a great maintenence product while I wait to get my hair done again. It helps the appearance of thinning and split ends at the end of my hair shafts. It does not ""reseal"" or repair split ends, but it does help the hair look thicker where it starts to thin due to the slit ends. The product is smooth and easy to work through the hair. A little goes a long way, and this product isn't even a quarter gone, and I have been using it for about 3 months once every 10 days. The smell is great, very tropical, and the smell stays on the hair. I have gotten compliments, and people have asked me what product I am using due to the smell alone. It is a nice hair mask that goes a long way. I use it about 20 minutes before showering on dry hair, and then I wash it out and let my hair air dry.

"Coconut Oil Hair Mask - Deep Conditioner with 100% Cold pressed Coconut, Argan, Rosehip oil &amp; Shea Butter - Repair and Moisturize Dry, damaged or Color Treated hair - for all hair types 8 Oz",5.0,"&nbsp;I am on a complete coconut kick.  It offers so many benefits.  Currently I am using a coconut infused shampoo and conditioner that has worked wonders and I wanted to add a coconut deep conditioner / mask to round out my hair care routine.

I have processed hair and it is damaged from a bad color job so I experience a lot of breakage.  The ends are weak and my hair is filled with split ends.  I can't afford deep conditioning treatments at the salon on top of getting my hair done, so an at home, do it myself treatment is perfect.

The container is a very generous size, 8 ounces.  Using this product once or twice a week I would imagine it would last a minimum of 3 months or more.  I opened the container and took of the seal and was immediately overjoyed and the yummy coconut smell.  The directions state to apply to hair after shampooing and leave on for 5 to 20 minutes.  I applied this mask in the shower after I shampooed my hair so I was only able to leave it on for about 5 minutes.  I rinsed it thoroughly.  When I dried my hair I was happy to discover that my hair wasn't greasy and the product didn't leave any residue.  Some masks can leave hair feeling greasy like it needs to be washed again.  The product itself is lightweight, like a normal conditioner.  It's not a heavy ""mask"".

Typically after I blow my hair dry, the ends are very frazzled, my split ends show and my hair just looks gross.  You can see in the video that my hair looks healthier and hydrated, definitely more nourished.

I am very excited to see what kind of results I will have after I use it a few more times.  This is a great alternative to expensive treatments.

Dexe Root Touch Up - Cover Up Your Gray Between Coloring - Instant Results - Root Concealer For Black Hair,4.0,"If you hate dying your hair, and if you like to go as long as possible between dye jobs, this product might be for you.

A friend recently told me about Dexe Root Touch Up, I ordered it immediately, and I've used it several times. There's still plenty more left in the box, too, so I plan to go a very long time (three to four months -- maybe longer) before I dye my hair again. (Then again, if I had an important function to attend, I would dye my hair and not depend on this!)

Certain parts show more than an inch of gray -- where my hair is parted, of course and at the crown toward the back. It takes about a minute to cover those areas. Gray at the temples and in front of the ears is a little trickier because, even using the narrow part of the brush, the black waxy-talc substance gets on my skin. It looks like soot. Fortunately, it wipes right off my skin with a dry washcloth, while remaining on the hair. My hair is now very silvery, very white in some places and fairly coarse. This still covers it well and doesn't stand out too differently from the rest of my hair which is dyed with VS Sassoon Salonist Neutral Black #1/0.

I do see a little residue on my pillow case. I have to reapply this after shampooing. It does lend a certain ""matte"" or dull feel to hair where it has been applied.

"Luxurious 100% Natural 8x Bath Bomb Gift Box - Large 3.5oz Size - Pure Essential Oils for the Best Lush, Relaxing Bath. For Women &amp; Men",5.0,"When I first opened the box I noticed the floral aroma right away. It smelled drop dead gorgeous.

Hard to choose so I picked the one I am most familiar with, ""So Pretty"" which contains ylang ylang, geranium, lavender and lemon oil. The bath bomb has an off white color. The rose petals are yet visible until you drop the bath bomb in water for a couple seconds. The petals are are not whole pieces but in smaller chunks. The amount of the rose petals are not a lot either which was kind of disappointing.
As for the scent of the bath bomb from the essential oil, it was very soothing and pleasing. There is no synthetic fragrance so the scent was very naturally and not overwhelming at all. I really enjoy sitting in the tub for longer than usual.

After getting out of the tub, I immediately regretted my decision so I stayed a little longer. When I got out of the tub for good I wrapped myself up and I notice the floral scent in my hair. I was so delighted. That was a good indulgence :)

I once bought a bubblegum flavor toothpaste because it was on sale and the flavor was overpowering. I ended up throwing it away. But this flavor is fine.

I like the idea of less mess but the pump takes a little more push power than you would expect at first. Not a big deal.

This toothpaste is great for the enamel as the toothpaste can make the weak areas strong and also it works on plaque buildup.

The label comes off so you can see all of the information wrapped around the tube and without the label, you can see how much is left. I also like the fact that it has a plastic cap on top that you can keep on it when not in use. There is a small area where the toothpaste comes out and that protect the area if you accidentally drop it on the floor.

This is intended for six year olds and up, as it has pretty much an adult amount of fluoride (0.24%). The pump says that kids ages two to six can use a pea-sized amount. Obviously the concern here is potential swallowing.

However, this is my error and it is in no way affects my rating and review.  The soaps arrived promptly and were packaged in 3 individual cardboard boxes that were held together.  The soaps are regular hand soap size.  It has a mild scent that is noticeable but not too strong to trigger a headache or a breathing difficulty in a scent sensitive individuals.  Personally I prefer highly scented soaps but realize that not everyone is like that.  The soap produces a nice lather and does not dry my hands, although I am used to applying a hand lotion every time after washing my hands.  The ingredients are all natural: green tea powder, glycerin, vegetable oil and water.  There are no artificial colors, perfumes or dangerous chemicals in them.

"Dermacol Make-up Cover #212, Mid-Brown/Pink, For All Skin Types",3.0,"There has been a lot of hype about this foundation. I am a makeup junkie, normal to slightly dry skin, light warm undertones. It is a very thick full coverage cream foundation that can look unnatural and pasty if too much is applied at once. Out of the tube it may not feel easily spreadable, I find that adding a drop of oil (any facial oil) and mixing it in your palm will make an easier application. It is best to build up coverage gradually rather than trying to achieve full coverage in one shot. I found using a foundation brush worked best. I would recommend using a primer and setting with a finely milled translucent powder. In terms of color, I would recommend that you view as many swatches online as you can. The numbering system is not necessarily indicative of shade gradation from light to dark. Some shades have much more pink undertones than others. This has SPF 30 which I like; some may find that a negative due to photographic flashback. Reasons for giving this 3 stars: (1) not an easy application; (2) can look unnatural; (3) will oxidize somewhat; and (4) availability of other full coverage products with more straightforward color match.",A1KSC91G9AIY2Z,3.0,3.0,4.0

BeautyWill 10 Piece Collection Eye and Face Makeup Brushes with Synthetic Bristles Golden,5.0,"I've bought a few sets of similar brushes on Amazon, and they're all basically the same thing.  There must be a single manufacturer or wholesale supplier, and then each seller rebrands them and distributes them as their own.  With that understanding though, these are still excellent.  The synthetic bristles do NOT drink up your foundation, so you don't lose liquid on application.  It's expensive to keep wasting foundation that gets trapped in the brush and washed down the drain after every use.  Also, the bristles are cut evenly, so all the brush shapes look correct.  I've purchased at least one set where the bristles were cut so crookedly that it looked like someone assembled the brush while blindfolded.

Three things:

1.  I'm sure people are  going to complain about how the brush roll smells strongly synthetic when you open it up.  It does.  But it goes away almost immediately.  It's the same kind of smell that you find on a lot of new plastic items.  Remember the way it smells when you unpack a new TV or DVR?  It's like that.  After a few minutes, you wouldn't notice it unless you stuck your face in it.  After a few hours, it's essentially gone.

2.  There's no explanation as to what each brush is for.  That doesn't bother me a bit, since I can always find a good use for a clean brush.

3.  The great thing about this set is that they DO NOT have logos on the handles, as shown in the product images.  The set I received has matte black handles, with no writing at all---which just how I prefer them to be.  Logos are distracting.

FYI, there's no storage space for any other makeup items.  I think it would have been clever to add a small zip pocket on the back of the brush roll, but I know that would have been potentially bulky and inconvenient.

Bottom line:  this was a great purchase.  I'm happy with this set, and I actually prefer to use these over my far more expensive Sephora brushes.  If I had known about these brushes before paying so much money for the Sephora brand, I would have bought these first.  They're soft, dense, they dry quickly after washing, and the bristles don't suck up all your foundation.  That's as good as it gets.

Less hair (dividing what I have into two smaller pony tails) calling for smaller holders.  However, the nature of these phone-cord type coils is such that they really cease to work at this smaller size.  In the larger size the coils ""dig"" in and out of the hair to both hold it and sort of spread it out while still being 'loose', but in this smaller size, even on my fine thin hair - getting them wrapped around even twice was a challenge (just getting my slim fingers in the coiled loop to get the hair through was not easy), and at the double wrap they are so stretched out as to be be almost 'straight' plastic - the coil effect is lost, and they band around the hair compressing it like a regular hair tie (except with hard plastic).

BeautyMe Blackhead and Pimple Remover Kit with 7 Surgical Extractor Tool,5.0,"This kit contains a selection of six tools for extracting comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and pustules (pimples) as well as splinters and thorns, plus a dentists mirror.  A zippered storage case is included.

The tools vary from about 4 1/4 to 5 3/16 in. long.  Some are rounded with knurling, some have square sections, and one is flat, but they are all easy to grip and handle.

A couple of the tools are similar, but this is a good assortment.  One extractor has flat rings rather than the ubiquitous spoon or cup tips and I find that they are easier to center on small blemishes because a spoon tip hides the pore.

They are made of stainless steel so that they can be sanitized after use with rubbing alcohol or a mild bleach solution.  They could also be autoclaved.

Professional tools like these make it easy to take care of blemishes with damaging the surrounding skin and causing infection and scarring.  To learn how to use these them, read the instruction pamphlet thats included and watch videos on YouTube submitted by doctors like Vikram Yadav or Sandra Lee.

"Temporary Eyebrow Tattoos #18 for Cancer, Alopecia and Hair Loss",2.0,"I suffer from thinning eye brows that have to be filled in and drawn on.  They are sparse to begin with and stop growing about half way above my eye.  Drawing them on and filling them in can be so time consuming and it's hard to get them on just right so I thought this would be a great option.

I was skeptical because they are tattoos and tattoos can be tricky to apply.  I really wanted to like this product because I think it's a great concept and it seems so easy, but I had a very trying time.  The first step is to cut out the tattoo as close to the eyebrow as possible.  This was tricky.  Once I held it up to my eyebrow I could tell it would be unnaturally long so I had to trim excess and then trim the other eyebrow to match.  It took me several attempts to get one on.  I don't know if my washcloth wasn't wet enough or if I have too much hair for the tattoo to stick too but application was too much for me.  Then to try and apply the other side and make sure it matches was even more tough.  I was able to apply and wear for 2 days but I felt self conscious the entire time.

As painstaking as filling my eyebrows in is, that's what I'm going to stick to.

"Dr Song Benzoyl Peroxide 10% Acne Wash Face, Body Non-Irritating Formula (4 oz)",3.0,"I have been critical of this brand in the past, and remain so now.  I am going to repeat the concerns that I've previously shared in the context of the 50% Lactic Acid Peel, because the issues still exist.

1.) There's no credible information.  No website, no record of Dr. Song, no record that ""Dr Song"" possesses medical training. Googling yields only a skimpy myshopify page with just 3 products, NONE of which is this face wash.  On the About Us page, there's only vague mention of it being a global pharmaceutical company, using pharmaceutical grade ingredients.  And yet, the only way to contact them is a single email address.  Any reputable company providing consumers with ""pharmaceutical-grade"" anything would have at least one support hotline for customers in case of adverse reaction or usage questions.

2.)  If this indeed contains 10% Benzoyl Peroxide,  then it sounds awfully high, as if it should be administered by a professional, and not by unskilled individuals without the benefit of any customer support resources.  Even the respected Murad brand doesn't go higher than 3.5%, and La Roche Posay and DDF top out at ~5%.  And all of those brands have trusted websites, customer hotlines, and prominently posted Hours of Operation.

3.)  Given the lack of credible information, it seems foolhardy to play with ""pharmaceutical grade"" products. However, as a person with very oily skin, I gamely gave this product a try.  The texture is thin and creamy, and it doesn't foam.  The smell is not great. It cleans well, but is very drying, to the point of leaving skin flaky. It takes some effort to rinse.  And you DO want to rinse twice.  Since I posed a question to the Q&A section, and got only a half-correct answer, I will answer myself right here:  Yes, any residual product *will* bleach clothing, pillowcases, and hair ON CONTACT.  How do I know this?  Because it unequivocally says so right on the bottle.  So that's a specific risk and opportunity cost for dark haired people, and it would have been good to be clear about that upfront in the product information.

So once again, having no other information to go on, it would be reckless to give this product more than 3 stars.  If you don't have sensitive skin, and have a devil-may-care attitude toward medical qualifications, then maybe this face wash works for you.  For me, it's risky and not particularly a joy to use, however, I can see trying it on less sensitive areas such as the upper back region.

I love the ingredients.  I used this first at night and sprayed my arms and legs and that of my husband as well.  He LOVES this.  He said it made him feel super calm.  I believe it helps us both with sleep.  He suffers from restless legs so I'm excited to see if this helps his flare ups.  I will say (the reason for the 4 stars) when you spray this it does leave a residue, wherever it's sprayed.  It feels like dried chalk.  I had white residue all over, I had to wipe it off (in which they say you can wipe it off after 20 minutes).  But it left my arms and legs, not sticky, but feeling like dried chalk.

"Love &amp; Hearts Valentine Gift Set w/FREE Lip Balm, Vegan, Organic Coconut Oil, Natural Aromatherapy Essential Oils, Gift Set 6 Bath Bombs, Handmade in USA from Enhance Me",5.0,"This was my first bath bomb purchase that smelled other than the herbs, and I was a little hesitant because it smelled a little too flowery for me when I opened the box. However, when I dropped the bomb in the tub I was pleasantly surprised with how subtle the scent was. My entire house smelled great! Whether you're just starting to buy Essential Me products or you've been using them for a while. This is one of my favorite bath bomb. It left my skin smelling faintly like fresh flowers and left super soft. These Love and Hearts Bath Bombs are a delightful bath time treat that are great for use either alone or with a partner. Once ""detonated"", it will turn your water a lovely shade of pink and scatter several paper heart petals throughout the tub. I found that these petals were relatively easy to clean up after, in fact, most ended up dissolved by the time I left the bath. It's scent is strong and floral, and tends to linger on your skin and in the room for a little while after you're done. I would definitely recommend this classic bath bomb to just about anyone.
I cannot wait to try some other bombs and purchase this one again as well. These bombs definitely takes baths to the next level!

"EmaxDesign 2 Pieces Makeup Blender Sponge Set - Random Pattern, Foundation Blending Blush Concealer Eye Face Powder Cream Cosmetics Beauty Makeup Sponges. latex free, non-allergenic and odour free.",5.0,"These are awesome sponges!!  I have tried many different makeup sponges, even the original Beauty Blender and these are very comparable to the original Beauty Blender.  They are just a little bit more dense, but they are the perfect size, maybe a little bit larger than the Beauty Blender.  Anyway, these are really easy to use, because they are more dense I don't find they suck up as much foundation as my other sponges, so they are less wasteful.  They are easy to wash out (I wash them with soap and water after each use) and they are always dry by the next morning when I use use them again.  They haven't bled much color.  Although I did let them soak in rubbing alcohol after I got them to make them bleed as much as they could, but now when I use them and wash them after they don't bleed pink or purple very much if at all.  Overall I'm very pleased with these sponges, especially to get 2 this size for $6.99 (the price at the time I am posting this) - is a great price.  Very pleased.

They come in a little nice box as well. I started by washing them per instruction and the blender got bigger.
I love that it did grab the foundation very well and it blended perfectly on my sensitive, combination skin that I was amazed that I couldn't even tell if I did put foundation on.
I also like that I can use one for foundation and the for concealer if I want to.
These makeup sponges are made from a latex-free, antimicrobial foam to help fight bacteria. Designed to be sensitive enough for those with allergies.

Bluezoo Nail Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Kit*FLOWER OF LIFE* 2 Stampers and Scrapters Included For Diy Salon,5.0,"Now these nail art stamp sets are absolutely wonderful. Please note that u need to take the blue plastic film off to get these to work. I'm not a pro at this by no means but I get better every time I do it. The few things I've noticed is you need to find the right stamper for the right job. And everyone has different preferences. Don't use metal to scrape or you will scratch up the plates. Also there are awesome tips on you tube that can show u how to do some really neat stuff with it. Highly recommended!!!!!!!I was lucky enough to get a discounted price to try this item out and let people know how it worked out for me. In no way am I obligated to rate one way or another.

Essential Oil Blend Anti Aging Serum for Skin,5.0,"I didn't know what to expect as I hadn't used this brand before. But serums being all the rage, I wanted to try it.

Serum is another word for light, smooth, and instantly absorbing oil. It's not really an oil but lotion doesn't make sense either. It's just a lovely few drops (you hardly use any) and it spreads all over your face and soaks in. You do not look greasy at all.  It's also not considered a moisturizer so you still need to moisturize.

My guess is that (pretend I took chemistry) the molecules or whatever that make this up are somehow smaller than lotion ones. So this goes on first, fills in the pores, leaves an even finish, almost like primer for your foundation. That's my uneducated guess. Because when you put on your lotion for night or day over this, it goes on smoother, you use less, and it feels like your face is smooth and also just a bit more hydrated.

Now, I grew up with a mom who slathered herself in Avon's night cream so much that I can barely stand anything Avon today. Just wore it like crazy and her pillowcase would crinkle after a day or two when that gunk dried.  This didn't show on my pillow case at all. It's completely absorbed, even with my Vichy night cream on top.  The bonus is, my kids can kiss me goodnight without being covered with Avon.

My big likes are that you don't use but a few drops, there's no fragrance issues, and it doesn't pill under foundation like some serums do during the day.

And best of all, my skin feels plumper and smooth: the only time it's okay to be plump in our society.

I rec'd a sample to consider for review. Positive reviews are not guaranteed and run the range from from one star to five stars, despite getting the sample item.  This is five star.",A2LAS014NSRW72,4.25,5.0,4.0
Essential Oil Blend Anti Aging Serum for Skin,5.0,"If you are looking for something to make your skin look super healthy, toned and vibrant this is a good option if you are used to using serums. I have been using this for two weeks now and found the best way to apply it is to add a drop or two to my regular face cream, then apply. Otherwise you get a sort of yellow tanned look that takes a bit to rub in and disappear. I found using it along with the face cream was the fastest and easiest way to apply it.

The oil is sort of yellow like a turmeric oil and contains rosehip, neroli, chamomile, rose, frankincense, lavender, and bisalolol essential oils. So you can see how healing this also is. I don't notice any scent from the oil it seems relatively mild. I think this bottle is going to last me a long time since I use so little of it. The results are great (including smaller pores!) and I'm happy I tried this product. It is a time saver since I don't have to blend my own oils.

Essential Oil Blend Anti Aging Serum for Skin,3.0,"This has a nice combination of oils and is very moisturizing,  as oils tend to be.  I didn't find any difference in firmness or wrinkles, I think you would be using this as a preventative and very early. I found the yellow tint on my skin disappeared after rubbing it in but it stained my natural fingernails and I needed to use polish remover. I received a free sample to test and review, I found its worth a try but be prepared to use it over the long term and deal with some staining",A3PEOF0GX4EN38,4.25,3.0,4.0
Essential Oil Blend Anti Aging Serum for Skin,4.0,"*product was provided to me by the company for consideration

I have been using this interesting serum for a while now and I'm impressed. Packaged in an air and light safe bottle with a pump dispenser this serum has a rich, golden-orange colour that lightly tints but doesn't stain the skin. The tint fades after a little while, so don't be alarmed if you are a little goldenrod coloured after application. Essential Smooth has a prominent herbal-sharp scent but it isn't too strong and it doesn't linger long, once applied. If you are sensitive, be aware that there are essential oils in this formula, including lavender and Neroli.

My favorite way to use this serum is to mix it with facial oil, press it into my skin hairline to bustline and work the excess into my hands and go to sleep and wake to soft, smoother looking skin and fresher, more youthful looking hands. This is a lovely product and I recommend it.

"Exfoliating Grapefruit Body Scrub for Face and Body Exfoliating Scrub for Acne and Inflammation, 12 Ounce by Pure Body Naturals",5.0,"I tried several products from this company. Pure body have a nice line of products. I love scrubs with different ingredients, I use grapefrut scent in the morning. The scent is all natural, which is a huge deal for me because any chemical scent gives me a headache. I have enjoyed every single product from them I have bought and I use them every day. I love that this body scrub exfoliates my skin without removing all the moisture. It lives my skin very smooth , like after day at the spa. What is does for me is helps me with exfoliating my skin. Here how I work with it: I scrub my cellulite areas with this product. I also add some body wash to the scrub in order for me to make my job of ''scrubbing'' easier. Then I use cellulite cream. Then, I apply a homemade wrap with grocery bags on top. Then, heating pad on the low settings, then, my waist trimmer on top. Have it for an hour. While that time I study or sleep. I also drink detoxifying tea during the procedure. After that I wash it all off, then scrub it again with this scrub and apply cellulite cream. I try to eat healthy, too. That's how I get result. Usually, it does not come just from one product alone. This scrub have such a great smell!!! it has a nice jar, too, so you can buy it for a present.
I was provided this product at a reduced price to complete and post a factual review without compensation. Positive reviews are earned only through positive product attributes and performance. I chose the scent because citrus helps me wake up in the morning.",A3R8RBOJ425KM7,4.75,5.0,4.0
"Exfoliating Grapefruit Body Scrub for Face and Body Exfoliating Scrub for Acne and Inflammation, 12 Ounce by Pure Body Naturals",4.0,"I like this scrub, as it helped me exfoliate my face and seemed to clear up my face and make it look younger while smelling awesome. I like the use of the product but mine came leaking.

I am totally partial to any grapefruit scent, and this product falls into line with my grapefruit obsession. It smells fabulous and leaves a scent on the skin, just what I like! It is a salty scrubber. I patted my face with water, placed a teaspoon of the scrub in my hands and scrubbed gently in little circles. It took about 30 seconds for the salty mixture to dissolve. I then washed off with warm water. I was nervous to do this multiple times because I had open acne with and without scabs. I thought that it would cause my acne to spread but it did not. The acne actually cleared up 50% after 3 uses of this product and did not further  spread. I followed the scrub with a cleanse, some toner, serum, and moisturizer. I looked in the mirror with good lighting after doing my makeup and noticed that my skin was smoother and I did look a few years younger. I had not exfoliated my face in 2 months prior to this, so I had some excess dead skin on my face. I am happy that my skin smelled good and that my acne seemed to clear up a little, and that I looked  slightly younger because of the exfoliation. The product did leave an oily residue on my face, so I did have to cleanse before and after use to make sure I didn't have any oil on my face clogging my pores. Product came leaky and opened.

"Exfoliating Grapefruit Body Scrub for Face and Body Exfoliating Scrub for Acne and Inflammation, 12 Ounce by Pure Body Naturals",5.0,"I received the Grapefruit Scrub for Face and Body from the brand Pure Body Naturals at a reduced price in order for me to review this product. I have tried other products from Pure Body Naturals, and have really liked them. This sugar scrub smells so sweet. It is amazing. I used this product in the shower after I shaved my legs. It left skin feeling soft and smoothed. I would not recommend using a sugar scrub for your face. Sugar is too harsh on the face. Do not use sugar scrubs or plastic micro beads. Plastic beads are bad for the environment since they can't be filter and are sent in to our oceans. They also cause tearing in the skin of your face. Your face is too delicate. But sugar scrubs are fine for other parts of your body. I used this product on my arms and legs. I just used it on my hands to make my hands soft. Just be gentle when you're using this on your skin. I highly recommend to use this after you shave your arms or legs. My boyfriend can't stop touching my legs and arms after I use sugar scrubs on my skin.

HBY Headbands Sweatband For Men Women - Design For Sports Workout Runnning Yoga - Stretch Moisture &amp;Wicking - 5 Pcs,4.0,"These are better than some other HBY headbands I tried, which were made of shiny spandex, and weren't stitched well.  These are actually made from a cotton blend jersey knit, which grips my hair better.  The seams are all good, and unlike the spandex headbands, which had GLUED ON tags, these have sewn in tags.  So the overall quality is much better, and the headbands are more comfortable to wear.  I received 3 black and 2 grey, as pictured in the product image.

The product description says these are 5 inches wide, but they're really closer to 4.5 inches, not that it matters to me.  The diameter is 8 inches. I have really smooth, slippery hair, so these headbands don't stay on all that well, but they still work for my purposes, since I use them to push my hair back when I wash my face.  I've tried to sleep in them so that my hair is away from my face (which helps avoid breakouts) but they don't stay on very well.  They end up around my neck or somewhere on the pillow!

I'd love to be able to wear these for running, but they won't stay on my smooth head of hair---but I'm guessing people who have more hair texture won't have a problem.  If you're looking for a sure-grip headband, you might need to keep looking, but if you're just looking for a wide, comfortable headband that won't leave hard dent marks in your hair, these aren't bad.

"Makeup Brushes, NESTLING Make Up Brush Set 32 Pieces Cosmetics Brushes Kit with Travel Pouch Black",5.0,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I own a lot of makeup brushes, its a bit of an obsession of mine and Ive become pretty picky when it comes to quality of brushes.  There are a few things I look to determine the quality of brushes and they're how well the brushes are put together, how soft the bristles are, and if the bristles are thick and full.  This brush set meets all of my requirements so Im pretty pleased with this set.

This is a set of 32 brushes, with most of the brushes being eye shadow brushes.  These come in a nice roll up case that has a kind of pleather look and feel to it.  When you have the case rolled up it takes up very little room considering there are 32 brushes in it, which is great for traveling.

The metal piece that connects the handles to the bristles is called a ferrule.  Ive gotten some lower quality sets where these are poorly glued together and are loose when they arrive and easily come apart.  These came glued together very well and held up when washed.  The bristles are super soft and they are nice and thick too.  When you pull on the bristles you don't get a ton of fall out either, so this is another sign of good quality.  You may notice a bit of a smell when you open them but washing them thoroughly will get rid of that smell and its not uncommon for brushes to smell like that when brand new.  I really like the variety of brushes and this is a great set at an affordable price.

DANCINGNAIL 2 Bottles 15ml Silver Mirror Effect Nail Polish Varnish And 15ml Top Coat Manicure,4.0,"This review is for the DANCINGNAIL 2 Bottles 15ml Silver Mirror Effect Nail Polish Varnish And 15ml Top Coat Manicure.

This mirror polish is fun but not 100% what I was expecting. For some reason, I expected my nails to have a foil finish like the Amazon listing. It is VERYYY shiny, but not 100% foil. The set comes with two bottles and there is a ton of polish in each bottle, one bottle is actual silver and the other is a special top coat.

The silver is almost like a regular silver polish from Orly or Julep. I have both silvers in both brands and its almost identical. I have to give it to the polish that it is very shiny but like I said, not foil like. When I apply this, I needed 2 coats. Just one coat was too thin and I could see my nail through. The two coats were perfect. I also coated with a clear polish  Seche Vite. The set came with a clear top coat but this top coat was VERY weird. It had the STRONGEST chemical scent I have EVER smelled, and I was wondering if it was actually UV/LED top coat??? It took FOREVER to dry and my fingers were BURNING the whole time. I had to take off the first application of silver and redo the whole thing with the Seche Vite after the clear polish was causing too much pain around my cuticles.. However, the whole drying time of this was VERY fast once I put the Seche Vite & Silver on and I appreciated that I didn't have to sit around for hours waiting for my manicure to dry. Also, its hard to apply this and not get streak marks. I don't know how they applied it so flawlessly in the photographs.

The polish lasted a surprisingly long time and did not chip or fade. Usually I only get 2 wear days max with regular polish before it starts chipping and I look like a hotmess. This lasted almost four days before chips occurred. On my toes  it lasted a good week before I took it off to redo my pedicure. The bottles are also surprisingly easy to hold and they are a larger size standard polish bottle. The polish was easy to clean off (its not like glitter polish that takes hours to scrap) but I just used a cotton ball and standard remover and it was gone in less than a minute. Overall, if you are expecting foil polish this is not for you, but if you want a good, silver shiny polish, this is PERFECT! 4/5 stars

Oliadesign Large Thick Finger Toes Nail Clipper Cutter Manicure Tool &amp; Rotating Head,5.0,"The OliaDesign Large thick nail clippers with rotating head are great.  These are the most unusual looking nail clippers I have ever seen in my life but boy do they work.  The head of the clippers rotates around 360 degrees.  This makes clipping nails much easier.  I have trouble getting to my left foot because I cannot bend my knee far. Normal clippers can be hard to use or get the angle needed to clip my toe nails easily.  With this nail clipper, I can rotate it to a position that makes cutting my toe nails much easier.  The clippers work very well and are very sharp. This is an innovated design.

The product has the feel of cream, is a whitish yellow color, and dries on the skin like a lotion clear. The smell is interesting. It isn't pungent but has a penny copper smell with a little tropical to try to cover the copper smell. To specifically test the power of this product, I placed product on one arm and didn't put it on the other. I went into the sun from 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM facing the sun. The arm with the bronzer lotion was two shades darker. Instead of being a yellowy orange glow that I usually have , I was able to get more of a dark golden color. It is a quick way to boost my tan.

"Nail Care System, Electronic Personal Pedi Manicure set, Files, Buffs and Shines Nails, Cap, 3 Insert Heads and Battery Included + FREE GIFT Toe Spacer and a Nail Clipper, For Home Use &amp; Nail Salons",4.0,"&nbsp;When I opened the box from amazon I found a reusable plastic pouch with a sliding closure inside. I opened that bag up and found:

1. The nail kit
2. The nail clippers
3. The toe spacers

Arbitrary as it may seem, my favorite part about the clippers is that they have a smiley face design cut into the metal. So cheery!
The toe spacers are not the foamy kind you normally think of for using when painting your nails. They are the type that go fully around each toe, and actually give your toe muscles a nice stretch. Our feet get crammed into weird shapes all day in our shoes, especially if the shoes have maybe a narrow or pointy shape, or if you have one toe that is a little extra long and it gets smashed every day... So it's good to put spacers like these on while you're relaxing to give your feet a good stretch and some relief, help them to get to where they should be more naturally.

Finally, the nail care tool. The packaging was plastic, but easy to open! Not the kind that you have to use scissors and then you get cut on the thick plastic. No, I actually pulled it open with my bare hands. (Im strong like that.. just kidding..) So the tool... It has a cap at the bottom for inserting and removing batteries. It's nice that the batteries actually came with this item! There are three inserts for the tool, and make sure they are packaged in the correct order in your package.

Step One: Use the dark blue, coarse grit to file the edge of your nails
Step Two: Use the light blue insert to buff the surface of your nail, the entire flat part of your nail
Step Three: Use the white insert to shine up the entire surface of your nail!

There are products out there that are a multi-sided tool, this is basically the same only it adds power to that. So you can just hold it to your nail and move a little bit, instead of moving vigorously with the other tools.

As with any new tool, there is a learning curve to getting the most out of it. With this one, I think the vibration is so strong that you need to learn the right amount of pressure to use. If you apply too much pressure, it will stop moving. So you need to learn how to use it and in that way and precision is a little challenging due to the strong vibration. I wish the other attachments could be stored somehow in the body of this tool rather than being loose. I know they gave you a big plastic bag you could store it in, but it would be even more convenient if it was built in. Like those pencils that have a bunch of tips inside and when one goes flat you shove it up the bottom of the pencil and a new tip comes out... Okay, so not exactly like that, but just the idea of being stored within would be great!

I've never tried another product similar to this that I can compare this to, but overall I like it. A couple areas I mentioned above that I suggest for improvement or tips for use, but at the end of the day, it definitely has the ability to perform its task, shaping and shining your nails which is great if you're not that into nail polish, but you still want to have a nice and healthy shine.

The other side allows you to gently massage your face and neck to stimulate blood flow and gently massage fine lines and wrinkles away.  The pulsing can be gentle or more rigorous to suit your mood or desire.  Because it's made with silicone, the BeneU Facial Cleaner and Massager is easily cleaned and won't harbor unsafe bacteria and germs.  I found that it left my face feeling really soft and smooth.

essie Gel Couture Nail Polish,5.0,"Rock The Runway: Beautiful Red Color, does not disappoint!

I love Essie nail polish, I have a nice size collection of the regular polish. I also love gel nail polish - I have my own tools (LED light).

Standard nail polish never lasts more than 24 hours on my fingernail no matter what I do. Therefore I was excited to try the 2 step polish that requires no LED light but resembles Gel Polish and a hopes for a 14 day wear.

I did two test runs:

Test 1:
Did no nail prep -I just followed directions, two coats of color, one coat of top.  Dries quickly, leaves great gloss

Day 1: Looks great
Day 2: Very small chipping to start on dominate hand
Day 3: Removed: Chipping on 85% of nails

Test 2:
I removed all the polish and prep my nails this time just as I would with doing real GELs. (Push back cuticle, buff nail to remove shine, cleans, add dehydrator, two coats color, one coat of top.

Day 1-2: Looks great, the shine lasted
Day 3: Chipping starting on dominate hand
Day 4: Removed

Granted, I did get a longer wear out of this polish than I have my typical Essie nail polish (or any brand for that matter).  I just have a naturally oil nail bed, but doing some of the prep-work I was able to get one more extra day of the polish.  So this is defiantly an improvement!

essie Gel Couture Nail Polish,5.0,"Rock the runway is a bright red that reminds me of a fire engine red. It goes on like a cream polish, nothing iridescent or glittery. It's that classic red but slightly updated by being a little less muted. This one stands out.
And this is one of the absolute best top coats out there, at any price. The only way to get a better one, in my opinion, is if you use a UV gel, and who wants to spend nearly 20 minutes soaking in pure acetone in order to remove a UV gel?
I find that this polish and topcoat removes quickly with acetone, and less quickly with a non acetone polish remover.
The top coat also makes any little streaks or flaws in the polish disappear.",A2YKWYC3WQJX5J,4.257142857142857,5.0,4.0
essie Gel Couture Nail Polish,5.0,"Rock the Runway is a simple, all purpose classic, pure bright but not overly-bright red. A Crayola red. A sharp choice for Christmas, Fourth of July, or even Valentine's Day. Creamy, opaque, quick drying and long wearing.  Just a great one.

All Essie's are great.  I wear them almost exclusively as they are almost the only thing that wears above a day on my crazy nails.  I can typically get about a week with any Essie (and I can go beyond that with their gel couture).  I do reapply top coat every 2nd or third day.

The Gel Couture polishes are a thicker more gelly like formula than the ""regular"" Essies.  They I also have a wider brush, but it's so nicely tapered that it's easy to work with.  I would recommend the ""Regular"" Essies if you want to do nail art, but for regular one-color wear, either formula is nice.  The Gel Couture line does wear a little longer, but I'm typically ready to change colors before I reach their maximum wear time.

One of my favorite aspects of Essie is that its very forgiving if you happen to be prone to messing up your nails.  They dry quickly once the top coat is on (the color is a little more vulnerable to marring before the  top coat is applied), and as they dry they self-level to give you a smooth glassy surface even if your technique (like mine) is imperfect.

The Gel Couture line really requires the matching top coat to get its wear time, but I use that top coat over other Essies quite often as well.

My Essie collection is approaching 100 bottles and my obsession shows no signs of abating.  I did receive this bottle free to review, however I routinely purchase these polishes with my own money.

I received a pinkish beige color called fairy tailor.  This shade almost matches my skin tone but it shows up because of the subtle variation in tone but also because of how it shines.  I'm applied two coats letting them dry before adding the top coat which added even more shine.

The bottles with their twisted silorite looks space agish but also makes them easy to hang on to.  My polish tends to show the most wear at the top of my nails where it rubs off.  After several days there's no sign of this.

essie Gel Couture Nail Polish,5.0,"Set aside about forty minutes and take your time with this. So, I waited for my favorite tv show to come on (so I wouldn't be tempted to walk around while waiting for my toes to dry) and began. In total, this is a three step process: apply a coat of color and wait, apply a second coat of color and wait, and finally apply the gel coat and wait. If you take your time, the end product is lovely! Nice color and super shiny!

Now, I know you might be tempted to use a heavier layer of color and then a heavier layer of color for a super rich look. Avoid this. By following the directions and using two regular coats, you are going to get a less streaky and more uniform color. Trust me, if you go a little heavy, it's going to take longer to dry and look clumpy. So, by going the easy route, the product is going to look its best. So, win-win!

This is a hearty polish! It does not chip easily and lasts over one week on fingernails and at least two on toenails! So, this is worth the price.

essie Gel Couture Nail Polish,3.0,"This set contains a nail polish and a topcoat, which are meant to give the appearance of a gel manicure.  They are also supposed to provide the longevity of a gel manicure, without the need for a curing light or the difficult removal process.  The color I received, Beau-Tie, is a pretty deep purple creme.  It looks quite blue-leaning in the bottle, but is actually much warmer on the nail.  In any case, the color was pretty, and the polish did look nice on my nails.  The instructions say to use the polish on bare nails (no base coat), do two coats, and follow with a coat of topper.  I did this, and I did have a nice, shiny manicure.  The shine was obvious, but I'm not convinced that it's anything exclusive to Essie.  There are other topcoats that will give you a similar appearance.  This polish definitely did not last the two weeks that the package claimed it would.  I found it lasted for about as long as any other polish when worn with a good topcoat- about four days.  The bigger issue, for me, is that without a base coat, my nails were in rough shape when this polish started chipping and I removed it.  They've been weak, peeling, and splitting.  The result is that I won't be wearing this without base coat again.  The bigger takeaway is that I don't find this to be fundamentally different from other nail polishes.  The ""gel couture"" business seems like a gimmick.  Also, I'm accustomed to using a quick dry topcoat, and this one takes much longer.  Be advised!",A3R9H6OKZHHRJD,4.257142857142857,3.0,4.0
essie Gel Couture Nail Polish,5.0,"I **LOVE** my Essies.  They are by far my favorite nail polish brand (and one of only two brands I will buy--only others are impossible on my nails).  Even though I have less-than-stellar technique and I am admittedly horribly hard on my nails, with Essie I can keep my nails looking professionally manicured without chips, redos, or drama. I am loyal to this brand for a reason!

WEAR TIME:  I'm fairly new to the Gel Couture line, though I've worn the classic Essie polishes for much longer.  I wondered how these would compare to my regular Essie routing (which is, Grow Stronger base coat, 2 coats of color, followed by Good to Go top coat), and I was astounded to find they compare very, very favorably.  I swear by Essie base coat, but was impressed that Gel Couture performed equally well with and without it.  (I do still like using it for a treatment layer and to prevent nail discoloration overtime; with Gel Couture I noticed no difference in wear time with or without base coat, though base coat  is a game changer with the classic Essies).  With my classic Essie colors, I tend to get about a week of wear, but do reapply top coat intermittently during the week (my goal is always every other day, but I usually forget pretty often).  In testing these out, I resisted reapplying top coat AT ALL, so that I could get a sense of how they wore on one application.  I'm quite impressed.  I got 11 days of wear, with a small few chips coming of the 11th or 12th day (depending on the shade).  I'm more than satisfied with that, given that I'm ridiculously hard on my nails and don't own a dishwasher.  Also, aside from Essie, I've found (at any price point) that there's only one other brand that doesn't chip within 24 hours (I can usually get 4 or 5 days with Revlon, so it's my second choice).  I went from a week with ""regular"" Essie to almost TWO weeks with these.  These last well past the point where I want to change my polish colors.

COLOR APPLICATION:  I've tried 7 of these Gala Bolds (as well as some from the original release and all but two of the Ballet Nudes), and I would say that with the exception of ONE shade, all of these polishes are dreamy to work with.  These are slightly thicker, more jelly like consistency than the classic Essies.  They are smooth and self leveling, apply like butter and look as smooth as satin.  The drip-free brush has a fabulous contour, so even working on my small nails, the wider brush was not an issue.  Most shades were opaque in one coat (but I'm a two coat girl, so I went for two anyway).  As Essie herself says, they ""Go on like silk and wear like Iron.""  The one color with a less stellar experience was ""Wearing Hue"" and if you sort Amazon reviews by color (yup, that's possible) you'll notice that most of the few negative reviews relate to that shade.  It's not an impossible shade, and milky opaque pastel colors are the more ""struggle-some"" colors in any range.  However, I did need a third coat to get to opaque and needed be more careful about not overflowing the nail bed. It still self leveled and wore beautifully.  I'd give this one shade 4 stars, but the others deserve more than 5.

(And anytime you are working with Essie, be patient with your perceived mistakes; give them a moment, they will self level and look as smooth as a calm sea even if you thought your application wasn't perfect.  They may be magic.)

TOP COAT:  I've taken to using this top coat with regular Essies instead of my Good to Go top coat.  There's magic in this bottle. Instead of getting 6-7 days with classic Essies, I can get more (though, I rarely want to, as I like to change my nail colors.)  With this top coat on Gel Couture, I am seeing 11 days!  Also, though I reapplied the Good to Go throughout the week, I don't feel the need to reapply with this one.  The Good to Go MIGHT stay a little (tiny bit) shinier through the week, but that's a hard call.  Though both wear well, this is my favorite.  Both dry super fast.  Like, ridiculously fast.  (I am currently testing the Gel Setter one, so I can't compare it yet.)  You do need to use this top coat with the Gel Couture polishes (or they won't last), however it's nice that it will work with traditional Essies as well.

I called Essie about this Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat, since I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be an improvement on the Gel Couture Top Coat (which is what it was called in the initial release of this line).  Essie has FABULOUS customer service, and they were able to confirm that it was a rebranding, and Gel Couture Top Coat and Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat are the same thing, just slightly rebranded.  (Not to be confused with the Gel Setter top coat, which IS different, and is NOT the one to use with this line.)

I can never recommend Essie enough.  They changed my nail game.  When I was almost ready to give up because fixing my nails took soooo long to do and to dry and I was getting so frustrated with fixing my mistakes, I discovered Essie.  They are MAGIC, I tell you.  They dry to a pro finish in spite of weak skills, and before I have a chance to screw them up.  And they stay on my impossible nails.  There's nothing remotely as good.  Love these!!!!",A2CZ98V784SRJ0,4.257142857142857,5.0,4.0
essie Gel Couture Nail Polish,3.0,"I really like the quality of this product.  I have used better gel ones though, this one chipped before a week was up.

essie Gel Couture Nail Polish,5.0,"I don't think any nail polish manufacturer creates as many different colors of nail polish as Essie, and I like almost all of them! This one is a lovely slightly violet polish in the red range. It's perfect for people like me who wear a lot of cool colors and have blue based coloring. The color in the bottle looks exactly like one in the photo on my screen, and slightly more red when it dried on my nails. I like it a lot. This color glides on very easily and almost covers in one coat. I did have to use a second coat to completely cover all the little spots that I missed the first time around. The polish looks good on its own, but the gel topcoat really sets it off. It gives my nails a hard, very shiny finish and helps to protect the manicure. It also smoothes out any imperfections that may have occurred when applying the first two coats. Don't skip it! The topcoat can also be worn on its own over bare nails for a nice shiny, finished look. But with so many beautiful Essie colors, why would you want to?

This polish was still going strong with only a hint of wear on the tip of one nail after 7 days. The top coat was still extremely shiny. My nails show growth at the base of the nail, so I usually change polish after 7 days. But if not for that, I probably could have gotten another couple days out of this polish.

essie Gel Couture Nail Polish,5.0,"This review is for essie Gel Couture Nail Polish set with the 144-inside scoop and platinum grade finish top coat.  ""Inside Scoop"" is a tea rose pink with a slight blue undertone. The color goes on streak free and doesn't require a basecoat.  I am able to get consistent, non-streak opaque color with one application - second application not needed but does seem to prolong the wear.  The top coat provides protection and shine.  It creates a hard shell which prevents chipping and has a high gloss.

I find this easy to remove and it lasts about 6 days with 2 color coats and one top coat.  I let it dry 3-5 minutes between each color coat and 10 minutes after the top coat.  The results look like what you'd get from a nail salon and lasts the whole week.  The shape of the brush allows for precise application.

Overall, I would recommend this product to a friend.",A1BK60GZ4QME6I,4.257142857142857,5.0,4.0

essie Gel Couture Nail Polish,4.0,"I love essie nail polish, I have a nice size collection of it. I also love gel nail polish - I have my own tools (LED light). Nail polish never lasts more than 24 hours on my fingernail no matter what I do. I was excited to try the 2 step polish that requires no cure.

I did two test runs:

Did no nail prep. Just followed directions, two coats of color, one coat of top.

Dries quickly, leaves great gloss

Day 1: Looks great
Day 2: very small chipping to start on dominate hand.
Day 3: chipping on 85% of nails

I remove all polish and prep my nails this time just as I would with doing real gel nails. (Push back cuitical, buf nail to remove shine, cleans, add dehydrator, two coats color, one coat of top.

Day 1-2: Looks great
Day 3: chipping starting on dominate hand
Day 4: removed

Because I can get a much longer wear than my regular polish I say this is a win. A girl (or guy) that tylically gets a fairly long wear with regular polish may get a 5-7 day wear but 14 days may be a streach!

The first coat of the pink goes on smoothly and easily. After drying, the second layer of top goes on. The top coat is hard to get off your skin, so be careful with it.

So far, this has lasted a week, with no chipping. It is supposed to last two weeks. It looks as good as a salon manicure. So far, so good.",A3M3W5GV0HIQK4,4.257142857142857,5.0,4.0

I can usually get about 3 days before I start to see the first chip. I then touch it up with some polish and put a new topcoat on and that will get me another day, but after that it's chipping badly enough that I need to redo my nails.

essie Gel Couture Nail Polish,5.0,"If I could give this duo six stars, I would. The combination of these two is, without a doubt, the best offering essie has ever put out there.

First of all, I hate it when you get a cream polish and it takes three or four coats in order to get it to look opaque. There was so much pigmentation in this nail polish that I could have gotten by with just one coat, although I put on two. The photograph shows the two coats on my hand.
After doing one hand, the polish started to thicken up a little on my second hand. I've noticed that this often happens with quick dry formulas. No problem, I just wait a minute and then reshake the bottle.
If you don't do that, it can come out thick, which makes it a little streaky or textured. Even if that's the case, all of those imperfections disappear when you apply this magical top coat. No, I'm not exaggerating. It really is Magic.
It evens the color and gives you a perfect shine that lasts for days and days.

And here is the part that I want to shout out... If all of the above weren't enough to make you really love this stuff, hold on because there's more.
I have long complained that I don't like the Essie nail polish brushes. They're great if you have small and short nails, in my opinion, but not for me.
The brush has a perfect curve that matches the base of your nail, and it's wider so that with three strokes, middle side, and side, you are DONE. The brush holds just the right amount of polish.
This review is for the VIPlease color. I think of it as a hibiscus or raspberry shade.
It looks great when you're wearing blue, pink, and even certain shades of burgundy. It's absolutely stunning with tropical prints that include flowers and greenery.
Getting the kit is a great way to try the top coat.

essie Gel Couture Nail Polish,4.0,"Review update:

While Essie states 'up to 14 days', one has to assess what effects those 14 days.

First off, this is an extremely pale opaque white with a hint of pink.

Application will require 3 even light coats of this shade, followed by its top coat.  Let dry thoroughly between.  Not quite the gel shine tho.

This color is pale, which could account for results.

This polish will hold up well for two or three days if nails are protected somewhat. It will show signs of wear and small chipping at nail tips. It can be touched up effectively.",A914TQVHI872U,4.257142857142857,4.0,4.0

The special oval-like brush gives excellent results. The gel top coat has a strong smell, but it does leave my nails looking like they have just been polished.

We soaked our feet in water, washed and dried, and then filed the toenails. We applied a clear base coat. Two layers of this amethyst color and finally the top coat. Glossy and shiny results. On to the manicure, soaked our nails in mild soap and water, dried and filed our nails. Again, the same base coat. Two layers of the amethyst color and finally the top coat. We are a blazing color duo. I am usually more conservative in my colors, but I just love this amethyst on my toes and nails. We have received compliments, and people have requested the color and make of the polish.

So far this mani-pedi has lasted a week, with good results. One chip on my granddaughter's little toenail where she tripped on a stone. We both give this nail polish and color five stars!

How To Train Your Dragon - Record Store Day 2016 Exclusive,5.0,"The movie came out. I work in an elementary school and am surrounded by kids constantly, so naturally I have to go see the cool (and quality) movies that excite the kids (and this one looked pretty good.) So I went to the theatre and thoroughly enjoyed the enchanting story and incredible imagination. So no disrepect to those aspects of the movie whatsoever.

BUT I firmly believe this movie would have not been what it was without the score. I can't remember the time I had heard a score that so well matched the story and emotion of a film. This movie is loosely based on a children's book and I think the music somehow brought along that literary magic. Just listen to the music and you can tell more or less what part of the movie it is. I remember sitting in the theatre, stunned at how well this music supported the story.

Thus, I am calling this storybook music. It's sweet, simple, and all the while completely joyous/powerful/sad/whatever the occassion called for. A little Celtic touch completes the magic, not to mention those certain chords tying all the pieces together. I left the theatre believing the music was the best part of an already awesome movie and downloaded the album.

And here is an example of this music's power: My classroom, last week, was painted and recarpeted. This of course meant that moving back in was hell and at this time I still don't know where a quarter of my things are--including the CD player used for listening centers, story readings, and the five minutes after recess where I play instrumental music to calm down the kids. So instead I pulled out my music-playing phone and turned up the volume on this album. Every student who had seen the movie IMMEDIATELY recognized what the music was (and became very excited and defeated the purpose of the calming down period).

If squirrly first graders are touched enough by this music to recognize it, well, I can't tell you a more powerful testimony.",AOTMP0OKJOUWI,5.0,5.0,4.0

Cordless Wand Massager - Strongest Handheld Therapeutic Vibrating Power - Best Rated for Travel Gift - Magic Stress Away - Perfect for Muscle Aches and Personal Sports Recovery,5.0,"&nbsp;Ive used beauty sponges for a long time now and there are A LOT of sponges out there that are just awful.  Theyre nothing like the real beauty blender and they're just an absolutely waste of money.  I will be 100% honest, I did not have high hopes for these sponges, BUT I wanted the little stands and two stands at this price would still be a great deal.  You get three different products and Im going to break down the quality of each product for you.

First up is the actual sponges.  I have tried several off-brands of these and this is literally the closest thing Ive ever bought to the real beauty blender, without the super spendy price tag.  This is sponge is amazing!  I gave the 2nd sponge to a friend who didn't have the money to get a new one and she referred to this sponge as life and all I can say is my foundation has literally never looked better. I don't believe you can currently buy just the sponges, but Im hoping that will change!

Next you have the holders themselves. These are fantastic! Before I got this I would just store mine in a drawer and I know it probably wasn't the most sanitary practice for something you use to apply face makeup and this is literally so much better.

You also get a little pad thats great for cleaning your brushes.  I think you can also use it for your face, but I prefer to use it for cleaning my brushes as it works great.  Overall this set is just fantastic and well worth the price.  I cannot say enough how much I love the sponges and the holders.  I *thought* I had a fairly decent sponge before I received this one and I was so wrong.

essie Gel Couture Nail Color Plus Top Coat Kit,5.0,"The color was a little too peach for me; but the nail polish overall was impressive. It stayed on for about 4 days without chipping at all, and by 10 days only the edges of my nails had chipped. Definitely not as good as getting a gel manicure in a salon, but far better than regular nail polish you can do at home by yourself. It also dried fairly quickly - I waited about 5 minutes in between coats and it did not smudge at all. I also liked that it removed easily and did not need to be taken off at a salon (or let's be honest - scraped off at home). I will definitely buy this in more colors!",A3AMWB410JE4Q6,5.0,5.0,4.0
"Alteya Organics Bulgarian Rose Water - 250ml / 8.5fl oz, From Our Rose Fields and Distillery",3.0,"The smell of it was not that appealing to me. I added it to my mix of serums that I use. I keep my serums and a few other products in the fridge to help keep them out of light and to help make them last longer. Then I have these .5 oz. black containers ( that I purchased on here ) that I mix my serums in along with a couple other things like peptide products. I do this so I'm not having to apply ten different products separately. I bought this as an addition to add to that to give it a nice rose smell and the benefits of rose water. Well it seems nice to the touch and feels nice, but the smell is just not appealing to me. I love the packaging of this product, but the smell is just not for me. I'll use it until it's gone ( which will take a bit of time ) but I will not be repurchasing it nor recommending it, all due to the smell. It's a shame because I had high hopes, liked the packaging, like the feel on my skin, but it just does not smell like roses to me.

Amalia Antioxidant Defense Moisturizer.,5.0,"I was so excited to try out this cream from Amelie Skincare! It seemed like it would be the perfect moisturizer that I can use every evening. It has so many amazing ingredients for anti aging!

I have been using this cream every night before I go to sleep. This cream is very easy to apply and absorbs quickly into my skin. The cream itself does feel very luxurious. It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy, which is super important to me. I have been using this anti wrinkle and lifting cream on both my face and neck. It's important to take care of your neck as well as your face. I love that you do get so much product for what you pay. Since you don't need a lot, I know that this huge jar will last me a very long time. This Amelie Skincare antioxidant renewal facial cream also has a light and pleasant scent. It's definitely been a treat to use this on my skin!

After using this cream for about a week, I have noticed results. My skin looks smoother and my fine lines are diminishing. I have also noticed that my skin is much firmer than ever before. My skin also always feels hydrated and moisturized for the whole day after I use it, when I only apply it in the evening! It has made my skin noticeably firmer too!

"Dr. O&rsquo;Neil's Best Choice Acne Treatment Cream with 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide, Retinol and Tea Tree Oil. Specially Formulated for Minimal Skin Irritation and Fast Results.",4.0,"Fortunately, I'm well passed the age of acne. I purchased this product for my two teenage daughters. While they don't have severe acne, they usually have a few blemishes they're battling at any given time. I'm always on the lookout for the best OTC product to help treat these minor break-outs.

This cream has a lot to recommend it. There's Benzoyl peroxide at 2.5% which is the effective recommended dose that doesn't further damage your skin, tea tree oil for it's antibiotic properties, retinol palmitate for cell turnover, glycerin for moisture retention, hydrocortisone as an anti-inflammatory, and glycolic acid and lactic acid to help clear away dead skin cells. Theres' no drying alcohol in it either (isopropyl, SD or denatured).

Ingredients: Benzoyl peroxide, Purified water, Glycolic acid, Cetyl alcohol, Glyceryl sterate, Ceteth-20, Steareth-20, Caprylic Capric triglycerides, Prunus amygdalus (sweet almond) oil, PEG-23, Glyceryl Distearate, Dimethicone, Stearyle alcohol, Lactic acid, Benzyl alcohol, Caprylhydroxamic acid, Tea Tree oil, Glycerin, Hydrocortisone, Benzalkonium chloride, Tetrahexydecyl ascorib acid, Tocopheryle acetate, Retinol Palmitate.

The cream has a thin lotion like consistency and it disappears once it's on the skin and it's easy to use a thin layer of product. It comes in a generous 2 oz jar. I love the size but I don't like the jar format. I would have much preferred a tube. There's also a prominent scent of tea tree oil.

One of my daughters though it was too irritating. The area she put it on turned red and she said it stung. As a veteran of anti-aging creams, my guess is the glycolic acid (2nd inactive ingredient) irritated her somewhat sensitive skin. She didn't want to use any more which was fine. However, my other daughter loves it. She's been using it for a few days and experienced only mild stinging. Her existing blemishes look much reduced and her overall complexion looks brighter. Her skin is also not getting overly dried out which has been a problem in the past. I think this is an effective acne treatment but those with sensitive skin should probably go slow when trying it.",A3S5FRDKD52VBG,4.0,4.0,4.0

I have used the artis brushes in fact I owned them for a week and used them everyday for that week. Then I received these dupes and I fell in love with them. I know that ppl say the artis are better blahblahblahblah. No they're NOT! Maybe they're trying to justify the 500$ price tag in there head and believe they're better. I don't know. But the artis brushes were given to me as a gift , after I had already purchased these. These did not come in until after I had already been using the artis brushes so I figured I'd give these a week. Honestly I had shedding from the artis and not these. These are plenty dense and I personally do not see that the artis were any more denser. I loved these so much I spoke to my mother in law who had gifted the artis brushes and asked if she minded if I return them. I bought 6 yes 6 full sets of these brushes for EVERY WOMAN in my family!

"Fanme F-003 Hair Straightener Brush 2 in 1 PTC Ceramic Brush Ionic Hair Straightening Comb Magic Silky Anion Anti Static Hair Detangling Tool, Black",4.0,"I received this Ionic Hair Straightener brush for free to test and evaluate.

This is very much like the others that I have tried. There are buttons that adjust the temp, turn it on and toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit. This brush says that it has ""ionic"" strength. I cannot verify this.

There are a few differences between this brush and the others I have tested in recent months. This one has the buttons on the back of the handle instead of on the side. One button turns on the ionic function, one button is the temp/on off control. This brush heats up very hot, up to 450 degrees, hot enough to sizzle your hair if you are not careful! The one thing I love about this brush vs the other brushes I have tried is that it does not have the odd little red balls on the ends of the brush tips. This brush has flat and smooth brush ""bristles"". (No give to them, they are rigid.) They snagged my hair much less.

I have frizzy hair and no matter what I try, ceramic, ionic, metal, etc.. My hair looks the same after each, so if there is some magic to the way ""ions"" work with my hair, I am not seeing it. I am not using a heat appliance to make my hair healthy.  If you notice a difference then this will please you because it has the technology to help your hair.

How does it work? It functions much the same way as a flat iron except this glides through the hair instead of along it. It takes the same amount of time to use this as a flat iron, I didn't notice that it saved any time at all over a flat iron. It still must be used on perfectly dry hair. (That means heat protectant spray needs to dry before using this. Steaming your hair is probably not a great idea, but do as you feel is needed, I am letting my hair dry first.)

It gets my hair smooth and sleek and is as easy to use as the flat iron. It is good for days where the humidity is going to bring out the frizz or when I want to go a day between washes but my hair has frizzed into a bozo look, even in a pony tail. This can tame the frizz in about half an hour if I am combing my hair flat, or in 4 minutes if I have my hair in a pony tail and am taming only that. This style of straightener brush snags less hair during use than the other models I have tested. That is a major bonus.

I am not sure what is easier to use or which one I prefer. I have both the flat iron and this brush sitting there. I alternate between them because I don't have a favorite.",A1MF83RMFXN6TF,4.0,4.0,4.0
RUIMIO Eyebrow Shaper 4Pk &amp; Eyebrow Stencil 9Pk,4.0,"You get four shavers in this package, but now that I've seen them in person, I realize the drawback.  Two of them are excellent--the smaller ones which measure 0.75 inch in length.  But the other two have very long blades--1.25 inches--which means that they're dangerously difficult to control.  I don't mean dangerous as in deadly, but dangerous as in imprecise.  If you're shaving sideburns this might not be a problem, but I'd be too scared to put a blade this long near my eyebrow.  One false move, and you could be missing a huge patch of hairs!  If you don't have the steady hands of a surgeon, I wouldn't recommend using the long blades on your face.  The short blades are a lot easier to handle, and block less of your view.

So you just have to use the right tool for the job.  If you need to do fine detailing, definitely stick to the small blades, and save the large blades for non-face areas!

"Supreme Retinol Moisturizer Cream By WiseNaturals | Perfect Anti Aging &amp; Wrinkle Face Formula | With Hyaluronic Acid, Active Retinol, Vitamin E &amp; Green Tea Extracts | 1.7 OZ (Packaging May Vary)",5.0,"Retinal has been proven to slow down the breakdown of collagen in skin and reduce dark spots. After using Retinol products for several months, I can say for certain it is producing noticeable improvement for my skin. The hyper-pigmentation between my eye brows has faded significantly and fine lines are smoothing out. This is a good quality anti-aging moisturizer containing the most Retinol (2.5%) I have seen in a skin care product without a prescription. From my personal experience, Retinol has been the best choice for my sun damaged skin since it has helped improve my discoloration and skin texture.

I like the fact that it is made with organic and natural ingredients which is something I look for in any facial skincare product. The ingredients included in this product such as organic Aloe Vera, Vitamin E, organic Jojoba oil and green tea are great for skincare, especially for the elasticity and collagen boosting. There are no added fragrances or colors to aggravate my sensitive skin and nose. I love the unique pump design as it protects active ingredients from sunlight and oxygen not to mention it makes for easy application. One pump will generate enough product for my face and neck. There is no more dipping unsanitary fingers into the jar to potentially contaminate the product. I appreciate the inclusion of an expiration date as well.

Due to the high amount of Retinol as indicated, I start out using this cream once a day in order not to dry out my skin, then gradually increase my application of it to twice a day. This moisturizer absorbs into the skin quick and well within minutes leaving a smooth surface which can be used as makeup primer. It does not leave a greasy feel or impact my foundation when applied. It is comfortable enough to be worn in warm weather without getting sticky or making me feel sweaty. This moisturizer makes my face feel well hydrated and nourished when I apply this cream at night after my toner and Vitamin C serum. I have sensitive skin, but this product does not cause any breakouts or negative reactions. It makes my skin feel much smoother and firmer than it ever has before. I have also noticed that some of my fine lines on my forehead are slowly diminishing. Overall, this is a wonderful moisturizer cream that has significantly improved my skin tone as well as texture and I would definitely recommend to others.",A2XZM64TLWL34O,5.0,5.0,4.0

New York Biology Eyelash Growth Serum - 3.5ml,5.0,"The Ultra Lash Eyelash Growth Serum comes in the standard style tube with thin brush applicator. The black and silver design is sleek and stylish. It contains 3.5 ML of serum which is more than other serums I have tried in the past which contained 2.5 ML for a similar price.

Its easy to apply this very close to the upper lash line (and you can apply to your brows as well, if you wish.

I try to apply this every night before bed and also when I get out of the shower in the morning. I notice more of a difference when I use these products twice per day, although sometimes they say to use it just once per day. So follow the instructions on your package, I'm just saying what I do.

Now don't get me wrong, I don't have falsie-length lashes now. But I do notice that my mascara goes on better now - my lashes are fuller and longer which helps the mascara to do it's job better. I can also tell the difference because before starting, when I curled lashes, I could barely see them when in the curler. But now, I can see that they are almost to the top of the curler when I am curling them. I know that sounds confusing, but it's hard to explain. If you curl your lashes, you will understand hopefully. Just look in the mirror while you curl and notice the length of your lashes compared to the length of your curler?

So with consistent use, I do feel this product makes a difference. It's not a miracle product, and for the most part, no product is. But giving your lashes extra nourishment is a good thing and it's a nice way to pamper yourself and add it to your relaxation and skin care routine! :o)

I actually only got this kit because I wanted the tiny little scissors and the other things looked more useful than other kits I've seen. However, everything in here was nice. I've never used a heated eyelash curler but I was happy with the results. I wish there had been instructions on how to use it, but I just turn it on when I start my makeup and I do my mascara at the end to give it time to warm up. It takes two AAA batteries. I use the eyeliner brush with the spooly brush at the end as a clean up brush for nail polish, and it works great for that. I also use the pointed tweezers to pick up nail vinyls which works SO MUCH better than using my hands. The slanted ones, I actually use for my eyebrows and they are good. They grab my fine hairs as well as the deeply rooted thick ones. The mirror compact is in my purse. No complaints there. The scissors cut and I like the slant.

"Am&eacute;lie Brightening Eye Cream For Dark Circles, Puffiness, Fine Lines &amp; Wrinkles With Antioxidants, Green Tea &amp; Peptides. Brightens, Depuffs &amp; Firms. Organic &amp; Natural Ingredients.",5.0,"I am a college student with a very inconsistent and haphazard sleep schedule. My sleep schedule has caused me to get some serious under eye dark circles. I was worried about how it was affecting my appearance. Even with piling on concealer in the morning, I still feel like my severe dark circles are visible. I was so excited to try out this eye gel in hopes that it could help me!

I have always had dark circles, and after using this eye cream for a few days, they have been going away! My dark circles have been much worse this past year, so I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find a product effective enough to help. I wish I could get more sleep or have a more consistent sleep schedule. But that's impossible, so I need something like this eye cream to reduce the appearance of dark circles! This saves me so much time in the morning, since I don't have to worry about putting a ton of concealer on.

After applying this product, my eyes do feel moisturized but not greasy. The product absorbs very quickly into my skin. I really dislike when creams make me feel greasy, especially around my eye area, but I don't have to worry about that with this gel! It is very quick and easy to use every night!

This product has many ingredients which are good for your skin, which makes it an insane value because you only need this cream for your eyes. You don't have to worry about applying so many different products, when this is all you need! The components of this eye cream are known for their anti aging and skin brightening benefits!

Asgens Acrylic Oval Makeup Brush Storage Organizer 10 Lattices Cosmetic Display Shelf (Clear),5.0,"&nbsp;I have the most beautiful oval makeup brushes and until I received this holder I had no good way to display my brushes.  I was keeping them in a container in my drawer but that was not only unorganized, but super messy as well.

This acrylic stand is perfect for displaying and storing your oval makeup brushes.  So basically this is two pieces of sturdy and durable acrylic and you just put it together with the two included screws.  Once you put it together you have the perfect stand to organize and display your oval makeup brushes.  The holder is maybe a foot or a foot and a half long and its not very big width wise at all.  I don't have a very big vanity but Im able to place this on top of it and it fits fantastically.  If you have oval makeup brushes this stand is an absolutely must have.

Norelco 6826XL Quadra Action Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Men's Shaver,5.0,"I've had this shaver for several months now and am very impressed with its performance.  I don't know if it's the ""Quardra Action"" or not, but it consistently gives a comfortable, smooth shave.  Moreover, it's quieter, gives a closer shave, and is more comfortable to hold compared to more moderately priced shavers.  The Norelco 6826XL is also easier to clean: Shake it out in the trash, then rinse under tap water.  Occasionally, you might want to manually clean the cutters with the included brush.
The Norelco recharges quickly (a few hours for full recharging, several minutes for a quick one), has a nice solid feeling, and is angled for a more ergonomic experience.  Furthermore, the money-back guarantee appears to be the real thing; you can't lose on this one. The shaver stops fairly soon when the battery is almost used-up; there's really no need for the more expensive models that have a charge indicator light.
Face it, shaving is subjective, and will depend a lot on your preferences, the contours of your face, and the characteristics of your hair.  However, I have been very pleased with the Norelco and recommend it highly--I think the comfort, performance, construction, ease of cleaning, and relatively quiet noise level justify its price.",A1SYLII0808HD6,5.0,5.0,4.0

Norelco 8865XL Spectra Shaving System,4.0,"I bought this shaver a while ago, but I wanted to wait at least a month before writing my review, since it's supposed to take about that long before your face is used to an electric razor.
This is my first electric, and I was concerned going into it. I looked at the price of good standard blades, though, and saw how quickly an electric razor would pay for itself. I'll never go back. For the first week, the shave was not as close as I had become accustomed with using a blade. After that, though, I've gotten closer and closer shaves by the week. After a little more than a month of using the Spectra, my skin is now smooth even against the grain. I've gotten back to where I was with a blade.
The Pros:
- Shaving takes easily only half the time as it did with a straight razor.
- I can shave any time, any where. With a blade, if I tried to shave more than once per day, I'd cut myself all up into a bloody mess. With this electric, I do notice some discomfort after having shaved a second time in a day, but it gets a nice close shave. A little after shave takes care of the sting, and I'm good to go again.
- No mess. I really don't miss having to use shaving cream, even my nifty hot-lather shaving cream.
The Cons:
- Motor power seems to wind down a bit towards the end of the battery charge. It's not too bad, but it seems to take longer to shave at the end of the charge, and I don't want to charge it early for fear of damaging the battery.
- This is really a minor quibble, but I thought I'd mention it: Since this razor rinses clean under tap water, what few bits of hair are still left over are sitting in water over night. Every time I use the razor, for the first minute of shaving, it smells very strongly of old, wet hair.
Tips:
- Blade users: Apply less pressure than you're used to. I find I get a better shave when the razor is touching the skin firmly, noticibly, but not pressing in at all.
- Rinse it out every day, and turn the faucet up high. If you let it go a couple days without rinsing, it's much harder to clean out. It only takes a couple seconds, so why not?
- Shave daily. I find that if I let my beard get a little longer the shaver still does a pretty good job. However, there will always be a few hairs that grew too long, curling down, that are not lifted by the razor head. Just shave daily, when you only have stubble, to avoid this.
- Get a makeup mirror! These little mirrors are concave, magnifying your face so you can see where you've missed more easily. I mounted mine to the wall, slightly below my chin. Now I can more easily see if I've shaved my neck well.",A1UBUX7VM3QC9N,4.0,4.0,4.0

PanOxyl Bar 5% - 1 bar,1.0,"If you see a rave review of this soap on here that's prior to the winter of 2009, then they are talking about the old salicylic acid version of the soap and NOT the new formulation.

I never really had acne in highschool but when I got college aged, I began breaking out on my face, chest and back. I went to a prominent dermatologist and this is one of the things he recommended I use. I'm in my 40's now and until recently I used this soap every day in the shower. I hadn't had any real break outs for years and years.

A bar of this soap generally lasted me a couple of months and I'd stocked up with several bars so hadn't bought any for approximately six months. When I ran out and went to buy more, I noticed the box was different but didn't think too much of it. Within a few days of using the soap in the new box, I knew something was very wrong. My face felt hot and itchy. It looked almost sunburned and the texture was sort of rough, like nothing I'd ever had before. I still happened to have one of the boxes of the old version of the soap and noticed the formulation was a 5% salicylic acid. I compared it to the new box and noted it's now made with a 5% benzoyl peroxide solution!

I called the company and was told that they had bought the Steiffel lab company in the fall of 2009 and would no longer be making the salicylic acid version of the soap.

I did some research and found that Clinique makes a similar .5% salicylic acid version so I bought two bars of it. I don't like it quite as much as my old standby but it's still very good and my face is back to normal. Unfortunately, it costs almost twice as much per bar but it's still less expensive than many other treatments out there, it's simple to use and it works so I feel it's a worthy investment.

I also found that Aveeno has a bar using salicylic acid called ""Clear Complexion Cleansing Bar"". It was very inexpensive and I noticed it's available in lots of different stores where I live. I bought a bar of it but haven't tried it yet. I'll try to remember to review it as soon as I have used it for a couple of weeks or so.

My advice: SKIP this new formulation of Panoxyl bar soap! It's harsh, smelly, and doesn't control breakouts. Honestly, this benzoyl peroxide version is the absolute worst thing I've ever used on my face. I didn't even want to leave the house for a few days after using this only about 3 times.",A19SDJ2TSSL8HI,1.0,1.0,4.0

It is a thick, clear shampoo, lathers up nicely with a strong fruit scent.  My daughter's first impression is that ""it smells good,"" like bananas.

"Method Hand Wash, Pomegranate - 12 fl oz",3.0,"My neighbor Ted, the self-appointed bathroom and kitchen ""consumer specialist"" ran through the (regrettably) open front door, gleefully waving a small plastic grocery bag in his hands.  ""M., look what I have! A new hand soap and a cleanser from Method products!""  I contained my enthusiasm. ""Ted, why don't you join James in the den? He's watching the game and waiting for a pizza (see review of Tom of Maine's natural unscented deodorant for the events preceding Ted's arrival). Just give me one of them, I'll review it, and you can add this to your resume."" He was pitifully thankful.

Method Hand Wash (lavender) is an ok soap in one of those pump bottles; unlike similar products, however, it claims no anti-bacterial effects. The touch is slightly sticky, unlike more expensive, ""designer"" brands, and the lavender (thanks to a dye called violet 2, derivation unknown) is seen more than smelled. There is a very slight scent. It's effective, and leaves little or no residue.  There are lots of ingredients:Water, sodium lauryl sulfate, cocamide DEA, cocoamidopropyl betaine,glycerin, testasodium EDTA, aloe barbadensis gel, methylchloroisothiazolinone (who makes these up?), methylisothiazolinone (I'm thinking this must be a chemical relative), tocopherol, benzophenone 4, citric acid, sodium chloride, fragrance, and the aforementioned Violet 2.

"Method Hand Wash, Pomegranate - 12 fl oz",3.0,"My neighbor Ted, the self-appointed bathroom and kitchen ""consumer specialist"" ran through the (regrettably) open front door, gleefully waving a small plastic grocery bag in his hands.  ""M., look what I have! A new hand soap and a cleanser from Method products!""  I contained my enthusiasm. ""Ted, why don't you join James in the den? He's watching the game and waiting for a pizza (see review of Tom of Maine's natural unscented deodorant for the events preceding Ted's arrival). Just give me one of them, I'll review it, and you can add this to your resume."" He was pitifully thankful.

Method Hand Wash (lavender) is an ok soap in one of those pump bottles; unlike similar products, however, it claims no anti-bacterial effects. The touch is slightly sticky, unlike more expensive, ""designer"" brands, and the lavender (thanks to a dye called violet 2, derivation unknown) is seen more than smelled. There is a very slight scent. It's effective, and leaves little or no residue.  There are lots of ingredients:Water, sodium lauryl sulfate, cocamide DEA, cocoamidopropyl betaine,glycerin, testasodium EDTA, aloe barbadensis gel, methylchloroisothiazolinone (who makes these up?), methylisothiazolinone (I'm thinking this must be a chemical relative), tocopherol, benzophenone 4, citric acid, sodium chloride, fragrance, and the aforementioned Violet 2.

Ultra Body Wrap Kit 64oz (32 treatments),2.0,"First off Wraps are not Latex Free for those intolerant to latex such as myself SELLER FAILS Here to WARN YOU. Second the Manual or direction book that comes with this kit states clearly more than once it takes ON AVERAGE 4 ounces to be a full body treatment. Therefore 64 ounces divided by 4 equals only 16 treatments. So for me I have to use my own latex free wraps I bought else where. And I use my own nylon two piece rain suit because the so called free vinyl suit they supply is almost impossible to clean or keep clean and doubt if it launders through a washer. My inexpensive nylon pvc coated rain suit fits well and washes fine so it stays clean and I can move around as all elephants especially on the short side does not fit the free suit in this kit at all. Maybe it's left over from a comedy club special?
You ask if the stuff works? That's what you really want to know. That depends on you and your body and system. I use these cremes to combat over all edema build up caused by trauma to the lymph system. Primarily to help prevent and break up [fibrous & gel type pitting edema] fluids in both arms and legs. This brand works as well as most any of them for my purpose and needs.

I'll boost these treatments in a far-red-infra-red sauna set to 110 - 120 F. for 20-30 minutes too. Basically it does help but it's not a cure and I'm told there are no cures so I'm left to try to prevent it getting worse and treating it constantly with compression garments and treatments like these. It pays off over the cost of expensive Lymphedema massages and wrap sessions but you have to constantly work at it....no time off!

If this Vendor changes it's contradiction on coverage to 16 treatments and also informs people the wraps are not latex free I might have been more generous towards the kit. However since I have to use my own wraps and it's only half the treatment amount covered I suggest you look around for 1-2 of the 32 OZ jars which are easier to handle and avoid the kits themselves including this one.",A19MMYMZO363KM,2.0,2.0,4.0
100% Pure Fresh Squeezed Strawberry Lemonade Shower Gel - 16.6 fl. oz.,5.0,"100% Pure has been one of my favorite new cosmetic discoveries for a while now. Every product is natural, fun to use and over all smells heavenly! I love the body lotions, the scrubs and now I have veered onto the shower gel addiction, since I had a sample of the Strawberry Lemonade lotion, and it smelled insane, I knew that showering in that scent would be even better.

There are no harsh ingredients and not stabilizers, waxes and chemicals, every product is 99% vegan and smells like summer. This shower gel is very thin and  watery but when I use scrubbing gloves in the shower or a loofah, there is no issues, as it foams up beautifully and  leaves the skin smooth and greatly scented. The smell itself is the best part, tangy lemonade and juicy red berries marry into a mouth watering cleanser that makes me feel like standing under a waterfall of summer. The bright and mouth watering luminous scent is amazing, and makes me want to wake up in the morning and get ready for another day. Sometimes it smells so good, I wish it was drinkable, as the scent is too real for words.

I tried both and they work similar.
If someone really wants to get rid of wrinkles, scars, acne etc I recommend retinoids,for half price of this cream. This is the best active ingredient for the skin, all you need then is good sunscreen for daytime (as vit A must be used at night and is photosensitive PLUS start with lower % as it is very strong).

The problem is I never liked their new deodorant with the space age formula called ""endurance"" for it was slimy.  It went on slimy and tended to stay slimy for a while. It felt to me like you were putting on a thin lair of gear grease under your arm. I just wasn't into gaging how well it worked for I didn't enjoy the slime that went along with it.  Then the clear gel came along, which is sorta like a thick liquid that goes on kinda wet and cool feeling, but dries very quickly and best of all, isn't slimy like other old spice solids.  As far as the clear gels staying power, it definitely lasts longer than the original formula, and in case I didn't mention it, isn't slimy like their endurance formula.

Essie Bermuda Shorts Nail Polish,5.0,"Seen the fashion pages lately? Fall is officially purple/plum/magenta/violet mad this year.

I'm wearing Bogota Blackberry by OPI on my nails right now (a great deep burgundy color), but I'm aching to try this purple shade. I've seen it for a few weeks now on the toes of my Pilates instructor. She and I are both olive skin toned women of medium-dark coloring, and we carry deep tones well. This particular color she's been wearing--ie, Essie's Bermuda Shorts--looks nicer on toes than in the amazon pic. It's a strong purple that retains depth and brightness. And the fact that one pedicure has lasted her weeks (it's  now finally chipped and wearing off after nearly four weeks!) makes me want to try Essie for a change. (I've been a diehard OPI gal for years.)

So, I give the color a thumbs up for its compatibility with the season's color obession, and also for its plain old purple happy-joy-joy fun look. And for those of us who want quality, my observation of how this has endured on my dancer/excercise physiologist/Pilates expert trainer, who is constantly barefoot and using her toes, this is a great polish that wears nicely and lasts a loooooooong time.

Its very dry up here all year. This really helps. Also feels great when it's hot out.  UPDATE: I now give this product 10 stars! I purchased several of Burts creams and thought this spray would be the least valuable of the products. Boy was I wrong! The smell is still, well, kind of funny, but my face is radient, moist, and plumped up. I spray it on several times a day, and I can actually SEE the difference between the dry mess my skin WAS and the now, new dewy skin. I am a ""bee believer!"".",A3977OZLNA8LCB,5.0,5.0,4.0

"Secret Flawlessly Invisible Solid, Totally Fresh, 2.6-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)",5.0,"I've been using this in the Completely Clean scent for about a year, and really like how subtle it is.  Strong scents can overwhelm my sensitive nose and trigger my allergies to flare up, but this scent doesn't do so.

The product itself also goes on nicely and does an excellent job of keeping wetness and odors at bay.  Of all the antiperspirant I've used in my lifetime, this one is honestly my favorite.

The only slight negative is that it's not totally ""invisible""; if you're not careful when putting on a tight top, it will leave some white residue.  That being said, I've found that the white streaks it might leave behind come out more easily than have any other antiperspirant I've tried.  I usually rub the fabric against itself to remove the white stain or use a&nbsp;Miss Oops Rescue Sponge&nbsp;to wipe it off.

Since I can't always find this scent at my local stores, I'm so glad to be able to pick up a four-pack of it on Amazon.",A2V5R832QCSOMX,5.0,5.0,4.0

The scent is the best that I have ever found.  Unlike some anti-perspirants that leave an unpleasant heavy odor on your clothing and you end up having to wash your clothes, this scent is very light and pleasant, but the protection lasts until you wash it off.  The only thing that I did find is that it is not entirely ""invisible"" - it does leave some residue on the inside of your clothing.  A great find if you like some scent but can't tolerate perfume-y scents. Recommended.",AXJ1QYBUL86ON,5.0,5.0,4.0
Juice Organics Lip Amplifier - 0.5 oz.,3.0,"I bought this thinking that it would be nice and thick since it's an amplifier and can supposedly be used under lipstick, but it's kind of watery and thin, so I don't think I could use it under lipstick at all.  I've found that it stays on better if I apply it and then tap another coat onto my lips with my finger and spread it out.

Also, the citrus taste/smell tends to sting if your lips are chapped, and I haven't noticed any amplifiying properties about it whatsoever.

It's an OK product, but there are definitely better balms and amplifiers out there and so I know I won't re-purchase this.",A2V5R832QCSOMX,3.0,3.0,4.0

I get a bit on my ring fingers and warm it up between the two and gently pat it around the eye area.  I like that I can apply concealer almost immediately.  Bad news though, in the last day or two, I've developed REALLY dry patches on my lids and near the outer corners of my eyes.  The skin is starting to flake off and I'm bummed!

I prefer nice soaps - even though I just had marble put in my shower and my tile guy said to only use washes - they stick less to the surface.

After using this wash, I have to say, I am a convert! My skin was left very soft and according to my sister it is rare for a body wash that does not have sulfates to lather. This body wash lathers very nicely. I am done with soap. I highly recommend this product for its moisturizing and cleansing capability and because it smells great.",A2FTKJZVO9BUMH,5.0,5.0,4.0

" Crest Whitestrips Daily Whitening and Tartar Protection, 38-Count Pouches",3.0,"Crest Whitestrips-Daily Multicare Formula and Tartar Protection is designed for ""maintenance"" bleaching, to maintain the whiteness of your teeth once the desired shade has been reached. Therefore, one should use a Crest Strip product such as the entry-level system Classic Whitestrips&nbsp;Classic Whitestrips-Crest Dental Whitening System, 56 Strips, or a stronger product like Crest Whitestrips Premium&nbsp;Crest Whitestrips Premium- 7- Day Dental Whitening Formula System, 28 Strips&nbsp;before the Daily Multicare Formula with Tarar Inhibitor is used.

This product is used for just 5 minutes a day to maintain the whiteness of (previously) bleached teeth. (All the other Crest Whitestrip products advise a 30-minute treatment, once or twice a day protocol).  There are virtually no side-effects, such as sensitive teeth, or ""burned"" gums, as the contact time is just 5 minutes. This system has a 6% hydrogen peroxide gel, the same as Crest Classic Whitestrips. A tartar inhibitor is included for those who form tartar easily.

An alternative to this product of daily bleaching maintenance is to use one of the original systems again, such as Classic Whitestrips for 1-2 weeks to restore the bleach white color of the teeth.

Crest White Strips come in as many as 7 different formulations, which can be quite confusing to the consumer. Please remember the key difference in all these products is the strength of the hydrogen peroxide gel, and of course the price. The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the faster the bleaching result, and the most costly as well. Here is a quick summary of the products:

1. Crest White Strips Classic. This is Crest's first bleaching product, introduced in 2001. It has a 6% hydrogen peroxide gel, and is applied twice a day for 30 minutes for 14-days of treatment. It is still a very popular product, and perhaps offers the lowest number of side-effects.

2. Crest White Strips Premium came out in 2004. It is a 10% hydrogen peroxide gel, applied twice a day for 30 minutes each session, for 7-days of treatment. The 10% hydrogen peroxide strength offers a quicker bleaching result, but perhaps with more tooth and gum sensitivity.

3. Crest Pro Effects came out in 2008. It is another 10% hydrogen peroxide gel, but offers a 10-day treatment protocol - again, twice a day for 30 minutes each time.

4. Crest Advanced Seal is the latest product (February, 2009), and it also has a 10% hydrogen peroxide, twice a day, 30-minutes a day, 10-day treatment. The main advantage to this system is that the strip is more adherent to the teeth, and the user can talk, exercise, drive, be active, even drink fluids, with the strip in place. The other systems advise the user to be stationary for the 30-minute treatment time.

5. Daily Whitening Multicare is another 6% hydrogen peroxide gel strip. It is used just 5-minutes/day.  The only difference between this product and the featured product is the lack of a tartar inhibitor.

In using any of the Crest bleaching products, please follow the specified instructions that come with each product.

Crest White Strip products work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains. If you have severely stained teeth, especially those with tetracycline (an antibiotic) stain, the strips may not work well for you.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated in-office form of bleaching (called ""power bleaching"").

I gave this product a 3-star rating, as I don't think the consumer needs a tartar-inhibitor in the bleaching agent. Normal everyday brushing and flossing should keep tartar away.

I prefer Water Babies to some other brands, because it is colorless and waterproof.  The manufacturer claims it lasts 80 minutes in the water.  From my experience, I have little reason to doubt it.

The lotion comes out a light peach color and it smells a bit of green tea.  It isn't very strong or like perfume; it is subtle, but the scent is there and it is nice.  The lotion has a slight bit of sheen to it, and is just a tad pearlized with mica, but not enough to make you glittery.

It goes on slick, and wet but absorbs in very quickly leaving only soft, smooth moisturized skin.  The moisture lasts.  I don't have to keep applying it, after I use it, i can go for hours on the driest day before I even think about it again.  I had a sunburn the last weekend, and it was great.  It really helped and I haven't had any signs of peeling.

I tried the cleaner on glass, granite countertops, and ceramic. The bottles have both a spray and squirt option. The cleaner does work. It cleans as well as other cleaners.

We still have to do all those other things that we need to do to save our planet, e.g., stop climate change. Whether you buy this or not depends on how much you value the environmental friendliness of the manufacturer and the product.

There are now many companies now offering this cleaner on Amazon. I suggest shopping around for the best price.",A3FKGKUCI3DG9U,5.0,5.0,4.0

Dried Chili (crushed red chili) 16 oz. (454 g),2.0,"I bought this along with 3 other brands of red pepper flakes to make Hong You aka Sichuan Red Chili Oil or whatever you like to call it - the recipe calls for red flakes of chilis, mainly the outside of the chilis not the seeds, and produces the great red oil.  Granted, I don't know exactly what the right name for that specific type of chili flake is 'supposed to be' named, but I just went by the photo in the listing for this product - which looks for all the world like bright red chili flakes with no seeds.

Instead, what I got was mostly seeds, much like the type of seedy pepper flakes you see in a shaker at your local pizza joint - nothing like the photo.  I have uploaded two photos of the product I received, along side the photo that as of this writing is the phone used in the listing for this product (the one with the wide red colored band along the package top), I think it's pretty clear the products are not the same, even if all the words on the packaging are the same.  Anyway, so I put these chili flakes through the steps of creating the Hong You, pouring sizzling hot oil into a bowl on these flakes, and they did not produce any red color at all, so I went further and roasted them toasty in the pan - the flavor was OK, but it wasn't Hong You.  The words may be ambiguous enough that who knows if the product is accurate, but the photo is not accurate and that is really all you can go by when the product doesn't even have an official name from one brand to the next.",A2EWF2OWK60DJW,2.0,2.0,4.0

"Swissco Pumice Sponge Block for Hands and Feet, Removes Hard or Callused Skin From Hands and Feet with or Without Soap",5.0,"I went to see a podiatrist a few weeks ago. One of my complaints was a callus on the bottom of my foot. It hurt when I walk and I wanted to know how best to remove it. In the past I used a real pumice stone on it as well as a metal file (Dr. Scholl's Callus Reducer) but was not fully satisfied with the results. The podiatrist recommended this Pumice Sponge Block. His office sold it for $4 (so a little cheaper than Amazon if you include the cost of shipping). The sponge did not look impressive. I was somewhat skeptical figuring they are just trying to find another source of revenue for the office. But since it was inexpensive I figured I would give it a try.

The doctors instruction were to leather the sponge up with soap and use it every time I take a shower. After using the Pumice Sponge he told me to use Amerigel Lotion Amerx -Amerx - Amerigel Care Lotion. It has been three weeks since I began using this sponge/Amerigel and I am pretty impressed with the results. My callus no longer bothers me, and my foot feels smooth and soft.

I am attaching a photo of the sponge without a wrapper and at angle that gives you a better view than the official photo.

"clariSEA Pomegranate De-Bump Salt Buff, 15 oz.",5.0,"I've been dissatisfied with the appearance of the skin on my upper arms for years now.  I've had some success using a Neutrogena body wash and an Amlactin lotion, but I really thought I could use something with more exfoliating power, so I got some of this.  And I'm really glad that I did.

This product has no dyes or artificial fragrances, so it's much less likely to be irritating to those with sensitive skin.  (I have sensitive skin, although the skin of my upper arms is a bit less sensitive than say, my face.)  The texture is sort of whipped and this makes the product much easier to spread than other salt scrubs I've used.  You can actually feel the salt crystals when you use it (but it's a gentle feeling).  It also washes off easily.

I've been applying this 2-3 times a week before a shower and I'm already seeing a little improvement.  I'm a bit hesitant to exfoliate every day, but my current frequency of application seems to be just right for me.

I do not notice a strong fragrance with this.  There are a couple of natural plant extracts (ingredients list is lower on the Amazon product page) that could be providing a subtle scent.  At any rate, I'm quite happy with this purchase and would definitely buy this again.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,5.0,5.0,4.0

It just smells so nice that it makes me happy and cheers me up significantly.

Decades of Fragrance: 1920,5.0,"When everyone was wearing clear or neutral glosses, I wasn't phased. I'm a red lipstick addict from way back, and I just toned down the red and added a little gloss to update it.

Thank God, though, it looks like real, pure reds are making a comeback. I read about Besame's vintage cosmetics line, and as my MAC red was about gone, I figured I'd try one of their reds.

My coloring is a brunette with a very fair complexion. Frankly, except for goth dark reds, I can wear pretty much any shade. I picked Besame Red since it seemed middle of the line in terms of color, and I wanted to get an idea how this cosmetics line worked.

The first thing that surprised me is it comes on a card. This lipstick isn't cheap; you'd think the packaging would be a little nicer. (I get they're trying to do vintage cosmetics, but if you're going to make it look like Coty or Max Factor from the 40s, you probably don't want to charge a hefty price for it.)

The other surprise is that the tube isn't heavy. Everyone raves about the metal container, but like so? It's lightweight. I've had some heavy lipstick containers from luxury lines that bragged about the lipstick containers being jewel-like, and they were.

This container isn't.

So now with my quibbles out of the way, let me say the lipstick itself is NICE. Some said the lipstick is small; it isn't. It seems about the size of most lipsticks with a double bevel to make putting it on easy.

I always use a lipbrush (does away with lipliner and makes lipstick in the case last FOREVER. You'll get tired of the lipstick before it runs out.)

The first surprise is the scent. I don't recall any lipstick except some glosses having a discernable scent. This one does, rather vanilla-y. It's pleasant.

The lipstick texture in the tube is, surprisingly, moist. It goes on easily, but it's not so moisturizing that the color doesn't last.

I put it on and did the old fashioned lip blotting with a piece of toilet paper. With a super slushy lipstick, this will almost take the entire thing off. Not so with Besame. The color is very saturated and stayed on my lips nicely.

The lip blotting didn't get rid of the moisture. My lips still feel nice. The color lightened up a bit (which happens with blotting.) You're supposed to add another layer of lipstick after this, but I usually don't. The color was still very saturated, so there was no need for more.

The staying power is excellent! It lasted all day, and my lips never dried out.

If you love the color (and use a lipbrush), you'll get WAY more out of this true red to the point where you'll get tired of it before it runs out.

I'm definitely going to be investigating more of the Besame line.

N.B. One other trick that works if you want your lipstick to last into next week. Blot the first coat and put on a bit of powder with your finger - baby powder or compact powder does nicely. Blot again, and put on another coat of lipstick. It'll last through dinner and into next Christmas. :)",A2JCJJNY43QQIV,5.0,5.0,4.0

I bought it for my daughter, who is fair skinned and usually uses ""Ivory"" type colors of foundation from various brands. This one did not work out well at all. Much too yellow. Even putting it on the back of my hand looked bad and you could tell a definite yellow tone. The texture was ok, although the scent was a bit much, especially for a product that goes on your face - you can definitely smell olive oil scent. The finish is dewy/shiny and somewhat tacky or sticky. I don't think we would try any other shades of this foundation because the scent is not very pleasant and the finish was not what we prefer.

Dare Original Shave Cream 8oz,5.0,"For a great shaving medium, use Dare To Be Bare Shave Cream for a smooth shave.  It's petroleum-free, paraben-free, cruelty-free, and contains no animal products.  Dare to be Bare Shave Cream softens your hair, conditions the skin, and protects it from razor burn and skin bumps.  Dare to be Bare also has a pleasant, but neutral scent, so it can be used by both women and men.  It leaves no scent behind on your skin.

Just a pump or two of Dare to be Bare rubbed onto your legs and you're ready to shave.  Using firm (not hard), long, and even strokes, work you way up your leg.  Shave all the way around your legs, checking with your hand to make sure you didn't miss a spot.  Once you get to your knee, make sure it has some Dare to be Bare on it.  Step your foot on to the side of the tub so that you knee is bent.  This tightens the skin of your knee making it harder to cut yourself.

"Christian Dior Addict Lipstick Beige Casual for Women, 0.12 Ounce",1.0,"Don't waste your money on this lipstick unless you like the taste of PERFUME (bitter, alcohol laden)!!  What perfume is doing in a lipstick is beyond my comprehension!  YUCK!!  I love Dior fragrances (Miss Dior, Jadore) but this is beyond ridiculous!  The color is lovely, a nice nude, and I was hoping that this would be a great formula.  However, it stays on for 10 minutes maximum and sinks into the fine lines around the mouth.  The color wears off very quickly and all that's left is the goop in the fine lines!  AWFUL!! It's heavily fragranced (it stinks) and the taste....really terrible!  I also love other Dior makeup (foundation, powder, concealer) but I will never again buy another Dior lipstick!  Truly terrible!  I bought this lipstick at Sephora and will certainly return it!  I'm not spending hard-earned cash on something that is truly revolting!  If all I wanted to do is look at the pretty color, then I'd keep it.

Sadly, I returned to the store that I purchased it from but they did not have anymore.  Each time I visit that store, I always check to see if more of this wonderful lotion has come in, but so far, it hasn't.

Regardless, this is a beautiful bag, mine came with a separator and exactly as described. I will be purchasing Caboodles` bags again. I think the quality is very good.

NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil - Sex Machine u/b,5.0,"This is a very pretty pink that is suitable for those with light or medium skin tones.  I am light myself and it's very flattering on me.  I love the matte texture and it lasts quite a while without being dry at all, which is surprising for a matte lipstick.  The price on Amazon is outrageously expensive.  Sephora has this item for $24.  The only thing I don't like is that I have to carry a sharpener in my purse.  And having to sharpen it wastes some of the product.  But this is my only complaint.  Sex Machine is a pink with blue undertones and it looks great on those with pink or neutral (like me) undertones.  It is not a bright pink but rather, a soft one.  I have several of these pencils, Bettina (a light nude with a glint of pink), Sex Machine, and Dolce Vita (a soft red).  I wish there were more colors.  The matte texture is not at all drying and it has a creamy feel.  It lasts longer than other lipsticks I have, which is a selling point for me.  I highly recommend this product and also recommend buying somewhere else, as the price on Amazon is ridiculous.",A2JR5ZTSYSIQYX,5.0,5.0,4.0

Cream for Joints with Sea Buckthorn Oil and 13 Herbs 250 ml (Alezan),5.0,"Many years ago, I was a  runner. I used to race every weekend and I've completed 11 marathons with a best time of 3:27. I finally gave up marathoning at about the age of 50 because of recurring sore ankles. I continued running for  another 20 years but finally gave it up altogether at about the age of 70. The problem was sore ankles, particularly the left ankle. Those ankle problems continue until today and I'm now 77.

The ankle problems are no big deal and I'd do the whole thing over if I had the chance. I take some minor pain medications when they act up. One of my favorites has been Bengay Pain Relieving Cream. It helps.

A couple weeks ago, I slipped on a stairs and gave my left ankle a good  twist. Now, it really hurt and the Bengay didn't seem to help much. I was mentioning this to my Mother-In-Law (from Russia) and she  suggested Alezan Cream For Joints, a product from Russia. Okay, I decided to try it when I discovered it was available on Amazon.

The Alezan Cream is sorta like the Bengay in that it comes in a plastic tube, I put a little on a hand and then rub it in to my sore ankle. Afterwards I put a sock on that leg to control the Alezan over night. Acually, I have no idea if this is the correct way, in that the Alezon comes only with explanations, cautions and instructions in Russian. Such is life.

I'm really surprised that I've had excellent results, much better than with Bengay. The next morning, my ankle is pain free and walking  around on it was much  easier. What a relief! I can't imagine that a topical salve,  such as this,  does the damaged interior any good, but it certainly makes it feel a lot better. I plan to continue until my ankle feels better and then keep a supply around in case I ever injure it again.

"Colgate Total Advanced Pro-Shield Mouthwash, Spearmint Surge, 16.9 Fluid Ounce",4.0,"There isn't much you can say about a bottle of mouthwash.  You either like it or you do not.  We use different products in our home but they are always the big names (Crest, Colgate, Rembrandt etc.).  I guess it really depends on if I have a coupon and if it is on sale.

This mouthwash flavor of spearmint surge is what made us try it originally because that is what my husband and I prefer.  As far as mouthwash goes it is just so much better in cutting down the burning sensation compared to the Listerine brand.  I hate that feeling!  There was a bit of burning but not as intense.  The flavor was spearmint but it felt it to be a tad too sweet for my taste.  My husband enjoyed it and didn't complain of sweetness.  I found that using this mouthwash at any time did not react to my drinking or eating.  I also found that my breath felt fresher throughout the day; as did my husband which can suffer from a bit of halitosis at times.  If you have a chronic condition or feel that your breath isn't the best then you will feel a difference, but this is not a miracle cure for rotting teeth or debilitating chronic halitosis caused by a pre-existing condition.

When I worked at various dental offices when I was younger, we always gave out samples of Colgate products.  Even though I try to shop on a budget, I do find that I still gravitate to their products to this day.

Highly recommend if you are the type that needs the reassurance that mouthwash can provide.  Doesn't burn as much and is sweeter.

TOOGOO(R) Facial Beauty Tool Face Massager Facemaster 6 in 1 Set Pink for Woman,2.0,"I could tell from looking at this product that it would not perform very well at all.  I was right. This device is used for a vibrating massage and does not have rotating attachment heads.  The sponges are poorly glued onto the plastic part of the attachment base and thus falls off when used.  The batteries BARELY fit in the battery compartment so it defeats the purpose of it being a battery operated machine.  I saw no use whatsoever in the 3 pink attachment heads.  The side of the tool's handle is broken as well and must be taped together to stay closed so that the batteries can stay inside.  The return shipment back to its origin China is far more than what the product costs to purchase it so....yea, don't waste your money.

"Liquid Latex Fashions Body Paint, Metallic Silver, 4 Ounce",5.0,"""Jeff's Wife"" - This is not true to color, it dries quite a bit darker, as you can see from the pic, but since I only use it for nail art I don't care but some of you might. I bought the pink back in Feb. 2015, still using it just got tired of the color, and this one seems slightly less opaque but maybe it's because that one is pink on pale skin but a second coat fixes the opacity, (only 1 coat in the pic). It may leave a few specks of the shimmer on your skin when you peel it off but they wipe away effortlessly.

If you're new to nail art and want to use this for that, I do suggest you transfer some to an empty polish bottle (cleaned with acetone or brand new doesn't matter) using a syringe with some sort of tip, an eye dropper or even a straw, this will keep the large bottle from drying out. This 4 oz bottle will last you a very long time, I still have about half the bottle I bought in Feb. 2015, and costs a fraction of the price as those other brands marketed specifically for nail art.",AY49JOXTLDOG2,5.0,5.0,4.0

At first, I loved the product; it mixed well and was easy to apply to my curls. It also left my curls very defined and clean. however, I notice after a few month of use, that this product dried out my scalp which led to brittle, dry,  and fragile hair.  Unfortunately , this is my last attempt for clay washes for my hair, because it just doesn't work for me.

(3 Pack) e.l.f. Essential Luscious Liquid Lipstick - Nude Pink,4.0,"I got this for just $1 on the ELF website. The color is a really pretty nudish pink. Even though the name implies that this is a liquid lipstick, I think of it as more of a lip gloss with decent pigmentation. I really like it and given the very affordable price, it's so convenient to through one of these in each of your purses, an office drawer, the car etc. I'd recommend this.",A3LJLRIZL38GG3,4.5,4.0,4.0
e.l.f. Essential All Over Cover Stick Concealer 3205 Ivory,4.0,"I have this in several shades. I use one of the darker shades as a cream contour everyday and I really like it. This has a decent coverage and it's an adequate concealer, especially for the face. I have used this under the eyes for a long time and I think it does just an ok job, meaning that it tends to crease, given its rather creamy consistency. Again, coverage-wise it is ok, but I have moved on to better concealers for the undereye area, although you could make this work for you if you are on a strict budget, by blotting over it to prevent excess concealer from creasing. (The ELF HD Lifting Concealer and the ELF Maximum Coverage Concealers do work great under the eyes for just $3).
What I really like using this for now is to define my eyebrows. So, after I fill them in, I just retrace the edges with this concealer, cleaning up any mistakes and giving them that flattering defined and highlighted look. This concealer is perfect for that as it is easy to bend and it lasts all day. And for $1 on the ELF website it is a steal!",A3LJLRIZL38GG3,4.0,4.0,4.0

(3 Pack) e.l.f. Essential All Over Color Stick - Golden Peach,4.0,"I got this for just $1 on the ELF website. This is a very glittery creamy product looking just like the name implies: peachy and golden. Applied concentrated on the cheeks it works like a good summer blush (I am very fair) and blended out it leaves more of a golden shimmer which can work well as a highlighter (I have worn it in this way several times and liked it). I'd recommend warming this up a bit with your finger before applying it to your face - as opposed to applying it straight from the tube to your face, I find that it distributes better that way. I think this would be especially gorgeous for darker, warmer skin tones. For the price, I'd definitely recommend this.",A3LJLRIZL38GG3,4.0,4.0,4.0
(3 Pack) e.l.f. Essential All Over Color Stick - Golden Peach,4.0,"This is probably not the kind of item I would've bought on my own, but I received a full-sized one in an e.l.f. Beauty Bundle so I figured I would give it a try.  I'm actually pleasantly surprised.

First, the cons.  As a lip color, this is not great for me.  It's a bit too orange for my taste.  I didn't know how else to put it on, so I just used a finger to get some color off and applied it to my lips.  This actually worked well.  But this is just not very smooth or creamy and would probably need to be used in conjunction with a balm or gloss.

Now, the pros.  It actually doesn't look that bad on my eyelids.  It spreads smoothly and provides just a hint of color (use a primer, though, or you'll get creases).  Again, I just rubbed a finger over the stick and applied to my eyelids with the finger.  Also, this is a decent cheek color for me.  I tend to prefer pinker blushes, but will keep this around for days when I want a warmer color.  I swiped it across my cheekbones and blended with my fingers.  It didn't take much, and it blended with my foundation and powder quite well.

At any rate, this worked well for me, for 2 of the 3 advertised uses.  I'd definitely consider buying it when I run out, and would consider other colors of the same product, as well.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,4.0,4.0,4.0

This matches my lipstick perfectly (NYC Everlast:  forever fuchsia - which blew my freaking mind, by the way.  It's two dollars and stays on for*ever*), which I was worried about.  I also love that it's a retractable pencil:  it's easy to apply, it goes on smoothly, and it does indeed stay put.  I keep checking my mouth to make sure everything's okay - certain it's time to fix something - but no.  We're talking five hours and no touch ups.

On top of that, you get three.  With shipping, you're paying just over $2.50 per pencil, for a pencil that rivals much, much more expensive brands.  Definitely a good deal.",ALPDNNJCJ22DG,5.0,5.0,4.0

Caswell-Massey Dr. Hunter's Hand Care Set: Dr. Hunter's Hand Creme 2.5 Oz. &amp; Sleeping Gloves (2 Products),3.0,"I would give the lotion five stars; the gloves, only one.  Shortly before purchasing this configuration I had purchased the lotion for a little more than $12.  The lotion is wonderful - I love the scent and it moisturizes and softens and smooths my hands (you can read my review).  So I decided to purchase it with the gloves.  This was a mistake.  The gloves cost me about $7.50 more and in my opinion they are worthless.  First of all, the fit.  I have short fingers and I could barely get my thumb into the thumb part.  I don't know how someone with longer fingers would manage.  Then, lint came off in little bits all over my hands, which is not a good feeling.  Last of all, I don't think they do any good.  Instead of helping the lotion to ""absorb"" all they did is wipe the lotion off with their tight fit.  So, please, learn from my mistake and just spend your money on this wonderful lotion.  I would skip this pricier configuration with the gloves.",A19KOAGQJUXL18,3.0,3.0,4.0
Moisturizing Day Face Cream,5.0,"I received this is a review sample,after talking to the Doctor who developed the product.  As an Organic chemist myself (many years ago), I realized this person really knew her stuff.  That was enough for me to be willing to try it on my skin.

Well, the product, for my skin has been great.  The seller even says it contains a natural sunscreen! The morning moisturizer really does it's job and quickly.  My face looked all plumped up and stayed that way, especially after using her night cream as well, in the evening of course.

Please note all the organic ingredients the product offers.  It has a small smell to it, but that is because it is not filled with chemicals, scents and things that are not healthy for your skin.

So far, I really like,this product and will continue to use it and if I see any changes, positive or negative, I will report and update here.

UPDATE:  6/10/15

I have seen amazing results with this product.

The ingredients are 99% organic aloe Vera. It contains calcium bentonite clay, matcha powder, neem oil, Dead Sea salt, about 10 more ingredients you never heard of.

This product has stopped my adult acne, brought moisture back to my face, and done a great job of exfoliation.

Alaffia - Beautiful Curls - Curl Activating Leave-In Conditioner - 12 oz (FFP),1.0,"I just bought a bottle of this from Whole Foods. I noticed that the Alaffia people have added phenoxyethanol to this product. It did not
used to be in curl reviving tonic. I am surprised and disappointed that they put it in. It is known to be toxic. I wrote the company and told
them my feelings about this. If many people would complain, they would probably take it out.
See the following for a commentary.

Phenoxyethanol is a glycol ether. Glycols are a series of chemicals that find their way into all sorts of things: paint, lacquer, jet fuel..... Phenoxyethanol is used as an anti-bacterial in cosmetics as well as a stabilizer in perfume.

The product's Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) says that it phenoxyethanol is harmful if swallowed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin and that it can cause reproductive damage. The MSDS refers to 100% concentrations, so is it safe at lower doses? In cosmetics the concentrations are typically 0.5% to 1%.

There are several animal studies that demonstrate that it is toxic - with effects on the brain and the nervous system - at moderate concentrations. In Japan, there is a concentration limit for its use in cosmetics. In Europe, the European Union classifies it as an irritant and there are various studies (on rabbit skin, for example) that demonstrate reactions at low doses. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) data sheets show chromosomal changes and genetic mutation effects in testing as well as testicular atrophy and interference with reproductivity in mice.

I also came across a report written by a medical professional who contracted allergies after coming into contact with phenoxyethanol in a detergent used for cleaning lab equipment. It seems he wasn't a fluke. There are over 3,000 known allergans and they were studied, along with the data from 9,948 patients, by a research team in Germany. Phenoxyethanol was in the top 10. An Italian study also determined that phenoxyethanol is a contact allergan. However, a 1990 article in the Journal of the American College of Toxicology said that it was only a mild irritant to rabbit skin at 2%.

Concern that phenoxyethanol is a neurotoxin precedes the FDA. German research in 1999, concluded that it had neurotoxin potential.

Phenoxyethanol breaks down to phenol and acetaldehyde, acetaldehyde converts to acetate. Phenol can disable the immune system's primary response mechanism. Given that, it is at best ironic, that phenoxyethanol is used as an anti-bacterial in vaccines. Acetaldehyde occurs during the breakdown of ethanol, (alchohol and 2-phenoxyETHANOL), it is a suspected carcinogen. Inhalation studies have shown irritation of the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract.",AHS5D14VLYIKE,1.0,1.0,4.0

Acrylic Jewelry Ring Earrings Necklace Organizer 12 Grids with Mirror 1026B,4.0,"I tend to accumulate a lot of bracelets, rings, and earrings on my dresser. They never seem to find their way back to my large jewelry armoire because, to be honest, I like having the stuff I wear often close at hand. As a result, I have a pile of jewelry on my dresser that doesn't quite fit anywhere and is a pain to try to clean around. This little jewelry organizer is perfect for the things I wear the most because it displays them, protects them, and keeps them clean.

It's a simple square acrylic box with dividers and a mirror on top. The top opens and closes freely, and there is no latch, so this wouldn't be good for travel. I like it a lot on top of my chest of drawers and now that my jewelry isn't all jumbled up, I have half a chance of finding a pair of matching earrings when I'm rushing to get ready for work in the morning.

I received the jewelry organizer free in return for my honest review. My reviews are done in compliance with Amazon's TOS and FTC regulations, and I never guarantee a favorable review. I have personally tested this product.",A2PF6BJMN72RC1,4.0,4.0,4.0
Beauty Bridge - Anti-Aging Protective Day Cream,4.0,"Like the night cream, this day cream is more a lotion than a cream.

This is more hygienic than dipping fingers into a jar day after day, but what comes out really is thinner than a cream.  It's a lotion, as one doesn't normally pump out creams.

This lotion feels good going on and it has SPF 15, which I always look for in a day cream.  Sun protection is essential for preventing aging.  I like it.

"Drake's Devil Dogs Snack Cakes, 8 count, 13.24 oz",3.0,"My children loved Drake's Devil Dogs when they were in school. We had them at many picnics, and on my son's 30th birthday, his wife gave him a 'favorite snacks' birthday party with Devil Dogs as part of the celebration.  I note their history.

In 1888, a Mr Drake ate a piece of pound cake he enjoyed. By 1890, he had opened a bakery in Brooklyn that sold pound cakes, and went on to develop other products. In 1023 the Devil Dogs were born. Sometime in 2010, Drakes and Hostess was sold and good-bye devil dogs. Then in 2012 a new company took over, and devil dogs were once again on the menu.

I purchased a box of Devil Dogs recently. The taste has changed, not to my taste, exactly. Am not sure what has changed but certainly cheaper ingredients and lots of chemicals. An old taste memory is gone.

Popcorners All Natural Popped Corn Chips Gluten Free Kettle -- 5 oz (One bag),5.0,"Sometimes you want sweet, sometimes you want salty. Sometimes you want a chip and sometimes popcorn sounds tasty. This Popcorners Kettle Popped Corn Chips combine all four wants into one light chip with great texture. The texture is kind of a bubbly, quilted texture which enhances the chips' appeal.

The kettle flavor is just the right amount of sweetness to me so it's not overpowering, yet you can taste a bit of saltiness, too. And the chips are fairly healthy, as they are lowfat, low sugar and low salt.

Ingredients listed on bag: enriched Yellow Corn {Yellow Corn, Niacin, Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid}, Sunflower Oil, Sugar, Sea Salt. The oil used is a healthy oil and like the use of sea salt instead of regular salt.

These are air popped with real corn. One bag has 140 calories and is low sodium (110 mg or 5% DV) and low sugar (3g), so they are relatively guilt-free. There are no artificial additives or preservatives and they are gluten free. This kettle is one of my favorite flavors and the only sweet flavor they make. I like the sea salt, too which tastes like salted popcorn.

D.R.Harris &amp; Co Coconut Oil Cream Shampoo 150ml,5.0,"I like cream shampoos. They harken back, which is sometimes nice, but also a container of cream shampoo tends to go further than a container of liquid shampoo. I landed on this and decided to try it.

What I wasn't expecting was that my hair would feel so wonderfully soft and full after the first wash! It lathered beautifully with just a dab of shampoo, rinsed easily and without being fly-away or unmanageable at all, my hair is really so soft. I'm kinda stunned. (As I always do, I rubbed actual coconut oil on my hands and then ran my hands through my hair before blow-drying. But I've always done that. My hair has never felt this good so it isn't because of the light coconut oil finish.)

This cream doesn't really smell anything like coconut oil, but more like a clean baby -- I don't know why.

To note -- at the time I ordered this I didn't realize it was coming from a company in the UK, where I'm not. They delivered in a timely manner, given that the package was sailing across a very large pond, but I'll look for this product from a US distributor the next time I order.

Although. It's worth every penny, so wherever I can get it ...",A1KDQXZHQIG5QG,5.0,5.0,4.0

Su:m37? Secret Programming Essence (Korean original) 100ml by Su:m 37,3.0,"A fermented blend of 80 botanical/herbal extracts, it was raved about as the ""next SKII"", amongst beauty bloggers, gaining fervent cult status. Curious, I purchased a bottle at the Seoul airport and have been using it for over 4 months, and my bottle is almost empty. It's liquidy with some slip, and a nickel-sized amount is enough for one application.

Although it feels nice going on, and adds some moisture -- it just didn't warrant any visible improvements or effects that justifies the price to re-buy.

Leave-In Conditioner &amp; Hair Mask Argan Kit - Thick Hair Care Exclusive Herbal Oils Blend - Moroccan Frizz Control Styling Cream 10.1 oz and Deep Conditioner 8.5 oz Set,5.0,"Both of these products are phenomenal!

Hair mask: I have never used a hair mask that was this thick before. Most hair masks I have used before felt more just like thick conditioners to me, but this one really was so thick I had to work to scoop it from the container. I worked it through my hair and left it in for a bit while sitting in a sauna. When I rinsed it my hair was amazingly soft and silky.

Leave in conditioner: I worked this through my damp hair after using the hair mask, and it kept my hair from being too frizzy and kept it soft and smooth. My hair is naturally thick and curly, so this was an amazing change. I am in love with these products.

These sets are an amazing deal, and a great way to get a good set of products for a specific type of hair.

"Simon &amp; Tom Soft Peeling Gel, Moroccan Argan Oil Based Facial Cleanser for All Skin Types. 1.69oz",5.0,"I was sent a sample of this gel with a request to fully test it and evaluate it, and I am happy to report that it is, simply put, the best skin exfoliator I have tried so far.  I am a big believer in freshening up my skin with peeling products, both of the physical and chemical variety.  Over the years I have tried many different types and they all contain some sort of rough, gritty substance to mechanically rub off the top layer of the skin.  One of my peeling products has sharp fragments of pulverized apricot shells, another crushed salt, and my latest relies on sugar particles.

I have never seen anything like this gel.  It is completely smooth and yet, after a few minutes of massage, chunks of dead skin ball up and come away. I find that rinsing with water is not enough to remove all the residual cell debris, so I use a facecloth or a sponge.  My face emerges refreshed and smoother than I thought possible with pores visibly tightened.  My sensitive skin loves this product and I have never had any undesirable side effects.  It's the sort of thing I can use before a night out, followed by makeup, or simply to prepare my skin for serum and moisturizer at night.

The modern, sleek container is really high-end and beautiful to have sitting on my bathroom shelf and, at the rate it's going, the 50 ml (1.69 oz) contents should last at least a month with regular twice-weekly use.

I always look at the ingredients before putting anything on my skin, and the list here is full of most reassuringly natural extracts:  camellia leaves, sea salt, aloe vera, argan oil, orange peel, papaya, pomegranate, cucumber and Dunaliella (a micro-algae found in sea fields).  As with other Simon & Tom formulations, there is an equally long list of artificial and toxic ingredients that are NOT included.  It only took me a couple of uses to recognize this gel as the best peeling product I have used to date.  The fresh aroma and smooth texture make this a joy to use and, after rinsing, I don't feel as though I have rubbed away my fingerprints.",A234YLAS2MYYWA,5.0,5.0,4.0
"Simon &amp; Tom Soft Peeling Gel, Moroccan Argan Oil Based Facial Cleanser for All Skin Types. 1.69oz",5.0,"You know something is working right when your husband mentions that the skin on my face seems healthy and soft, and my teenage daughter mentions my pores look smaller.  I can actually see my pores have shrunk and my skin looks taunter, especially the area around my forehead, nose and cheeks.

I will mention that applying the gel will probably seem a bit unusual.  The jar itself  is very pretty and once I opened it and touched the gel I thought I placed my fingers into mucus.  LOL

You must first wet your face and then apply a good amount to the face using circular motions. As you massage it into the face it will begin to lump together.  The only way to describe this is like taking rubber cement and rubbing it between your fingers until it forms a ball.  It is not a mask that you later peel off, it is used more like a scrub that peels away your old skin cells leaving your face feeling fresh and rejuvenated.  Even though I keep thinking I am using too much, I was shocked that after a week not even 1/4 of the jar is gone.  So the consistency is quite thick and goes a long ways.

You will definitely see results after a few days.  My skin felt silky soft and firmer.  If only I could use it on other areas of my body that could use some firming up.

If you are Asain and have no lift or curl to your lashes... This is NOT the mascara for you. It feels great when applying and is easy to remove, but it flakes throughout the day.

Bourjois Paris Maxi Delight Bronzer,5.0,"This bronzer is fantastic!  It glides on easily without streaking, and seems to last a good long time without getting shiny or changing colour.  It gives me a natural-looking healthier look even when I don't have a tan.  No orange or coffee cast.  What works for me is to apply it very lightly, on top of my usual make-up (although, to test it, I put it straight on my clean but moisturized skin and it looked great).  The other obvious thing is to make sure you put some on your neck to avoid a visible difference in skin tone.

Since it has tiny golden specks, it is wonderful as an evening finish but I love it for daytime, too.  I bought both the 01 shade for light skin and the 02 for olive or tanned skin.  I use the 01 on my winter-pale skin and the 02 in the summer, to improve the appearance of my natural tan.

Pure and Natural Anti Wrinkle Beeswax Cream (50ml / 1.7 fl oz).,5.0,"Having tried several Fysio beeswax products in the past, I admit that I am already their fan and plan to repurchase Fysio products when I run out.  This Anti Wrinkle and Anti Ageing Beeswax Cream was not an exception.  It is not really a cream but rather an ointment but this was not a surprise for me.  It has a firm consistency and softens from the warmth of the skin.  It is a bit oily but gets absorbed quickly.  It smells so good!  This one contains sandalwood and geranium essential oils, and, of course, there is a wonderful beeswax scent.  I am currently suffering from eye eczema as a result of sun exposure.  My eyes feel raw after washing my face, and even my trusted high end creams are extremely irritating to my eyes.  Fysio creams are the most soothing ones out of all products that I tried, including those that are specifically targeted to eczema sufferers.  I just received this cream today, so I cannot really assess its anti aging effect, however, based on how it smoothes wrinkles and fine lines and firms the skin, I am pretty confident in its long term outcome.  I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but again, I plan on repurchasing it at full price, which I rarely do with the discounted products that I try on Amazon.  Fysio beeswax creams are definitely worth their full price.

Raw Essentials Revitalizing Face Moisturizer 1.5 oz.,2.0,"I received this moisturizer in a spa basket during a hotel visit, and have been using it for several weeks. The first feature that I noticed is that is quite runny; it actually looks like milk when you dispense it onto your fingers and you have to work quickly to apply it to your face before it drips off. The scent is hard to describe - not perfumed, but slightly raw smelling, like a bowl of chopped fresh vegetables. The description on the plastic bottle says ""...made with Certified Raw (tm) Complex combining the science of classic ingredients blended with nature's therapeutics including Tamanu, Monoi, Hibiscus extracts and Vitamins."" Apparently the ingredients are never heated above 115 degrees because enzymes die at higher temperatures.

A list of the ingredients is not printed on the bottle, primarily because it is a really long list - approximately 34 with water being the first listed. The natural claims don't quite mesh with the long list of ingredients, such as tetrasodium glutamate diacetate and potassium hydroxide. I assume these are the ""classic ingredients"". There are also plant based ingredients including sesame seed oil, coconut oil, and gardenia flower extract, among others.

Unfortunately, the lotion does not offer sufficient moisturization for my very dry skin, so I have to apply a small amount of another cream on top of it. It would be probably be sufficient alone if you had less dry skin.",A2BAAKZHSUGCDP,2.0,2.0,4.0

Retinol 2.5% + Gift Pink Airline Travel Bag Cosmetic Case - Nourish and Protect Your Skin Day and Night - 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed!,5.0,"This was a lot more luxurious than I was expecting. I was really impressed with this face cream. If you have problems with oily skin than you should only use this at night. In fact, it states that this is intended for nighttime use.

This is a powerful moisturizer and feels so luxurious when you apply it. I was so surprised. I have dry skin so my skin just soaked it right up and loved it but for some other people it could be too moisturizing, so that is why you should only use it at night before you go to bed. You will wake up with really moisturized and fresh skin. That is how my skin felt. You do not need to use much at all. Just a little bit because it really is a powerful moisturizer. Any excess I had, I would just apply it to my hands and my hands felt great afterwards.

 I love that this is packed with antioxidants that my skin needs. My skin loved this. My face felt soft and moisturized. There is no fragrance, which is great! Fragrance is actually bad for your face because of the chemicals they use and no one needs fragrance in a face moisturizer anyways. It smells natural, the way the scent should be. I had no reactions or irritations at all. I honestly love this moisturizer. It feels so luxurious just like a high-end brand or what a spa would give you. This is a high quality and wonderful retinol moisturizing cream that does what it is supposed to do. I am so happy to have found this cream. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a retinal cream or have dry skin. It does come with a pink plastic bag for traveling too. I was not too impressed with it, though. I just use it for ribbons and barrettes.  I received this product through a promotion for my honest and unbiased review.

My Beauty Diary Oligopeptide Treatment Mask 8pcs,5.0,These are authentic with the hologram on the side!! Omg I am in love with this company!! I have the strawberry yogurt mask and this one. I just woke up looked in the mirror and wow!!! I used this before bed last night along with my new South Korean skin care routine. All I can say is if you don't try these sheet masks you are missing out. My skin looks flawless and I am 41 years old. I cant wait to derma roll and use this peptide mask. If this is the result just on my non derma rolled skin. I can't wait to see results after derma rolled skin. I am hooked on this brand of sheet masks. This mask goes on with a plastic cover over it. You adjust the mask to your face then remove gently the plastic and you have your sheet mask. The My beauty diary masks I believe are made.from rice paper. They are very thin but full of essence. As a matter if fact while wearing this I kept rubbing the extra into my neck and chest. I will never be without this brand from now on. I have tried many South Korean sheet masks and my beauty diary is the best!!! Oh and be careful make sure you get the one for your skin issues and troubles. If you have oily skin get the ones for oily skin and so on. These masks should have 20 stars :-) :-) extremely pleased with my beauty diary,A1X5TZ8JNE5J6U,5.0,5.0,4.0
My Beauty Diary Oligopeptide Treatment Mask 8pcs,5.0,"I like this sheet mask b/c it's not filled with ""fluffy"" fruity extracts and botanicals -- i mean, those *sound* nice and do basic soothing and hydrating, but for real anti-aging? You need peptides.

Oligopeptides are the best kind (ask Paula Begoun and other credible skincare sources), so you're getting concentrated collagen stimulators and receptors to promote smooth, firm skin.

if you want a targeted anti-aging mask and have found little success in the ""fruity/floral/veggie"" masks--that's because your skin needs real actives like peptides. My Beauty Diary is a trusted, respected brand from Taiwan and sells well in most of Asia.

Of course do as all the Asian girls do; save the extra ""juice"" in the sachet to re-use as body serum, or another mask!",AZ26CDSJ363AH,5.0,5.0,4.0

"Pure Dead Sea Mud for Skin Care Treatment and Mud Wraps by Adovia - 11 Pounds Resealable Tub - Great for DYI Skin Care, Facial Mud Mask, Scrubs, Soap and Slimming or Detox Body Wrap - Used in Top Spas",5.0,"You read right! 11 whopping pounds of dead sea mud from Israel straight to my front door for reviewing and testing purposes from the company called Adovia.

Because there was so much mud in an 11 pound container, I decided to transfer some into little jars and some plastic zip lock bags.

I recently reviewed Dead Sea Mud from a different company and of course it wasn't 11 pounds worth of it but I got to try it for the first time.

That particular mud left a tingling prickly sensation while the mask was drying on my face, so I didn't want to keep it on for too long but I did leave it on for 15 minutes.

The texture in the Adovia mud mask is creamier then the other mud mask I had previously tried on.

I felt no tingling or prickling whatsoever with the Adovia mud mask.
With the other one, after application, I had to put moisturizer on to get some of the redness down. Although it left my skin soft.
But the experience that I just received with this mud mask from the Adovia was beyond my expectations. My face had no redness and it was baby bottom soft if you know what I mean. Lol
All I can say was wow! I did apply my coconut oil afterwards because that is my routine but in reality after the mask I did not need moisturizing. It felt incredible I couldn't stop touching my face.
Next on the list with this mud is my neck and legs and a little goes on a long way and it's so easy to rinse off with warm water.",A3QKWFC92S03MP,5.0,5.0,4.0

As you can probably tell by my username, I am very into my nail polish.  I often travel with quite a bit.  But travelling with my large pump bottles was cumbersome to say the least.  I got these thinking they would fit in my shower bag well and not be a problem.  However, they leaked...all over the place.  Also, I tend to fill up the reservoir of my pump bottles with a bit of acetone or remover to clean up.  These would not hold liquid in the reservoir for this action so I had to use an acetone dish.  i guess I should not be so harsh in my review of this but you figure a bottle like that that is meant to be filled with acetone, alcohol, polish remover, etc, would not leak when it is tilted on it's side.
To add insult to injury, this was in my shower bag on my bed when it leaked and the acetone stained my sheet.  YAY.",AML9BBDXHJFFM,1.0,1.0,4.0

Tattify Neon Nail Wraps - Flower Child (Set of 22),5.0,"I love this brand of nail wraps.  I see mixed reviews on Amazon about them and I find it interesting that there are so many mixed reviews. First, they are thinner than Jamberry.  DO NOT HEAT THEM,  They will curl.  I do not detect any smell either, and I have a good sniffer. Here is what I do to apply them. First, I find a base coat of polish which is the same color as the background of the wrap. I use Sally Hanson because it is inexpensive.  I do this because I do not like seeing where the nail wrap ends if it is a little small.  I apply that first. Usually only one coat, but sometimes two.  Then I clean the nail with alcohol wipes.  Next I measure my nails, and start sticking the wrap on. They are a little difficult to get off the plastic. I suggest using the wood end of the stick they give you AND tweezers which are not provided. I apply the nail wrap carefully, smooth it down the  I file the excess off and atain press down the wrap very tightly.  Next I apply a few coats of Sally Hanson top coat.  I am using ""Super Shine"" which I believe is less than 2.50 at Wal Mart. I like the high gloss shine, but they have mat finishes as well.  I will periodically apply additional top coats.  I can wear them for at least two weeks with little problems.  Occasionally one or two will lift.  I bought a paint on nail glue to put under the lifted part and then I press the wrap down with the wooden rod which comes with the wraps. This corrects the problem.  I love these wraps, they are inexpensive, easy to use and have amazingly quirky designs which works with my personality. I recommend these wraps!",A34B7GT56TE4CZ,5.0,5.0,4.0
Tattify Paper Plane Nail Wraps - Airplane (Set of 22),4.0,"Pros:
Adorable
Beautiful turquoise color.
Easy to see design.
Reasonably priced.

Cons:
Difficult to take off the sheet
Can only use one side if you have long nails.
They curl a little when you take them off the sheet.

I LOVE these wraps but had to give them four stars due to the difficulty removing them from the sheet and them curling when you take them off as they can stick to themselves and then they are unusable.
I have read some bad reviews about this product and I have to say, I am wondering why there are bad reviews. I applied mine two days ago and have washed dishes a number of times without gloves, took a shower, cleaned the house without gloves using chemicals, typed, among other activities were I use my hands a lot.  I have not had any issues with the decals.
I have a few suggestions when applying them. This is what I did, maybe it will help others.
1,. Know which nail will get which decal before you start.
2. Trim if necessary before you remove them from the plastic.
3. Have the design laid out as you want it to appear on you nail.
4. When you are ready to apply, clean your nails with an alcohol wipe to remove all oils.
5. Carefully remove the decal.  You may want to use the wooden stick they include with the package go prevent the decal from rolling on itself. You do not want to use your finger because if oil gets on the decal, it may not stick right.
6. Carefully apply the decal.
7. Use the wooden stick they give you to smooth out the decal.
8. File off the extra with the file the give you.
9. Put at least two coats of clear polish on the top of the decal.  This will not only give the decal a nice finish, but it may last longer.

Make sure the decal is not on your skin.  If you are concerned about the decal being too small, paint your nail the same color as the decal so when it is applied, it is difficult to see your nail until it grows.  I am VERY happy with this product and have had far less problems with this product than Jamberry.  I found this product better than Jamberry as Jamberry split apart leaving part of the decal affixed to the nail, and the top layer coming off.",A34B7GT56TE4CZ,4.0,4.0,4.0
Tattify Patterned Nail Wraps - Closeup of a Peacock (Set of 22),5.0,"I love this brand of nail wrap!  I buy a lot of Tattify nail wraps.  This one is ""textured"" which is not my favorite type as I am a former nail biter and the texture calls me to bite the nails, but I cover my wraps with clear polish and I just covered the wrap enough times where it is no longer raised. The pattern is cute.  I have had this set on for a week and it has not lifted at all.  When I apply, I put on a base coat of polish the same color as the base of the wrap; in this case a dark plum color. I do this because sometimes I use a wrap too small for my nail and I do not like seeing my nail edge.  By painting my nail, the nail blends in with the background color causing the edge of the sticker to blend in to the wrap.  After the coat of polish dries, I then apply the wrap, press it down very well with the tool provided, file off the excess, then cover the wrap with many coats of clear polish over then next few days.  On occasion my wraps will lift, so I just glue them back down with a brush on nail glue and apply another clear coat over the top.  These however have not lifted at all in over a week (8 days to be exact). The value of these warps, the beauty and quirkiness of the designs, and the ease of use, I highly recommend them.  You may want to use tweezers when applying your wrap.  It makes it a bit easier as they are a little thinner than Jamberry and if you are not careful and take your time they may roll on you a little. They unroll very easily though if you take your time. Hopefully you will like these wraps as much as I do.",A34B7GT56TE4CZ,5.0,5.0,4.0

Valdler Elegant Seed Pearl Rhinestone Hair Pin for Wedding Party Prom (White),4.0,"I got this beautiful and elegant hair pin because I am attending a ceremony and I wanted to add a pin to my hair.

LIKES:
- It is the perfect size
- It can be the perfect hair accessory for many up-do's but even if you do decide to wear your hair down, it will add a nice touch of femininity and romance.
- It is not super white in my opinion. I feel that it is a more like a pear or creamy white. ( I am horrible at describing colors so I am sorry.) I like that it is not a true white but you might need something different.
- The wire is flexible so you can position the flower to your liking and complement your hairstyle.
- The clip works nicely
- It looks handmade

DISLIKES:
- I think that it is handmade because the flower petals have rough edges and the construction seems to be that sturdy to me.
- Also, the packaging is not the best because when I received it some of the petals of the flowers wore bend and squash together.

Essence Lipliner - 15 Honey Berry,2.0,"The color on this lipliner is nice enough. If you have lipsticks that go with it, you might like the color.
But the quality is... well, GARBAGE.
If you want smooth application, forget about it. This basically jumps every mm, making application a pain.
If you want to blend - forget about it. The uneven application then sets and any blending attempts makes it worse.

I have this&nbsp;Essence Lipliner - 11 In the Nude&nbsp;at the same time, and for whatever reason, it's a modicum nicer than this Honey Berry one, perhaps because the nude color is less visible and more forgiving.

But in good conscience, I cannot recommend Essence Lipliners. I don't necessarily expect high-end performance out of drugstore labels, but the product should be usable and a decent duplicate for expensive products. This is neither, and suitable for a child's makeup drawer, at best.",A1JDBXPK20HBUW,2.0,2.0,4.0

Wnw Mascara C150a Max Vol Size .27fo Wet &amp; Wild Mascara C150a Max Volume Plus Mascara 0.27 Oz,4.0,"I love mascara and try as many brands as I can. I was actually sent a full sized tube of this Wet n Wild Mascara in a subscription beauty box from Walmart or Target or somewhere. I didn't bother to open it for a while because I am used to using Tarte, Lancome, and sometimes Maybelline and CoverGirl. Wet n Wild was never one I even really tried except a time or two.

The other day I saw the package and decided to try it. I have thin straight lashes and like drama. I don't like natural looking lashes, I want LONG, dramatic ones. As this says it is a volumnizing mascara, I expected it to maybe give me some volume and I would use a second mascara for length.

The tube is big and the opening is a bit TOO bit which allows a lot of mascara on the wand. I scrape the brush against the sides as I pull it out to avoid getting too much mascara on the brush and my lashes. To my surprise, rather than giving me volume, I got length and a lot of it. I got a bit of volume but nothing major . But the length! I got not clumps and no spidery looking lashes. The mascara didn't flake or smear and it lasted until I removed it.

Since that day, I have been using Lash Out Loud MaxVolume Plus sometimes with a primer, sometimes with another mascara that gives me more volume but it's fine alone too. I get enough volume so that I don't look freakish with long skinny lashes and I get separation. My lashes wing out on the outside corners, something that ""Cat Eye"" mascara never did for me. I am quite happy with this inexpensive mascara. Shocked but happy. If I got a tad more volume, this would be AHHHHmazing. But as it is, if you like length, no clumps, and spending a few bucks rather than double digits for mascara, this is one to try. I will buy it another tube when I run out of the one I have.",A331BHAR0TRLWT,4.0,4.0,4.0

FingerPaints Endless Wear DahLia Drawing,5.0,"This polish is great quality and I say that because even at one coat it had good coverage without much streaking. I only needed to apply two coats and I was set to go.  The other bomb thing about it is that it dried so fast and that was just air dry no lights no fan no blowing on it I just applied the first coat and by the time I finished my pinky on the left hand the polish was already dry on my right even after a second coat it was dry in a minute. So I thought that was awesome. What's really awesome about it though is that they had this one day until midnight special going on a few weeks ago and it just so happened that I had put a few other products on my wishlist at Sally Hanson dot com, so I went to their site picked out the polish color I wanted, added it and the other things I had waiting for me and bam one cool polish at no cost to me. It's for sure I will be purchasing some more in different colors now that I know that it's great quality at an affordable price! Thanks and have a great day!, ~Kiki",A20JT47EZTXM30,5.0,5.0,4.0

Tattify Rain Nail Wraps - Raindrops (Set of 22),5.0,"I love this brand of nail wraps.  I have bought over 20 different designs of Tattify after having problems with Jamberry metallic wraps splitting apart and the company not honoring their return policy on defective merchandise.  These are more delicate to put on so I would recommend using tweezers.  They can also be difficult to get off the plastic sheet. However they stick on the nail very well and last for a long time. When I apply them, I first paint my nail with a base color very close to the base color of the wrap. I do this because I do not personally care for the nail showing, but it is not necessary. After the base color is well dried, I put the wrap on as directed.  I next put a few coats of clear over the next few days on top of the nails to protect them.  The last set I had on lasted for two weeks without any problems and they only came off when I removed them. I wash dishes by hand, wash my hair, clean the house, type, go to work, and have no issues with these decals coming off.  I really like this brand, their price point, and their designs.",A34B7GT56TE4CZ,5.0,5.0,4.0

"Lavender &amp; Lemongrass Soap - All Natural Soap, Handmade Soap, Vegan Soap, Unisex Soap, Essential Oil Soap, Unisex Soap - Gift under 10 by Zaaina",5.0,"&nbsp;This is a hand-made soap.  You can always tell hand-made soaps by their slightly irregular shape.  What I like most about this soap is its scent.  The scent combination is unique and subtle.

I got three different scents Zesty Lemon soap, Grapefruit and Calendula soap, Lavender and Lemongrass soap.  The scents are definitely recognizable, but they are not strong and do not linger on my hands.

My three soap bars are sized 3.5""W x 2""L x 1""H. Each soap weighs 4.2 oz.  The soap is a plain brick but inside of each soap there are specs of mix ins.

I like that it is all natural, no parabens, no artificial dyes, no artificial fragrances.

I received this soaps for evaluation and review as part of a new product introduction. I loved all the soaps, if I had to pick my favorite is Lavendar and Lemongrass, Lavender is a dominant scent but in this soap I can definitely smell lemongrass which makes for a very nice combination.

My stomach was a little sensitive to some of the vitamins in the ingredients so I had to make sure I ate a little something before I took it but other than that I am really happy with these Hair Growth Vitamins and will continue to take them!

I have had the opportunity to try several hair growth vitamins over the last several months and I really like this one better.  I think it's better simply due to the fact it comes in tablet for as opposed to a capsule form.  This aids in easy swallowing as the tablet doesn't get stuck on your tongue like a gelcap does.  I highly recommend this tablet vitamin to anybody that suffers from any hair growth issues.  Whether it's simply too much breakage or as complex as thinning hair, this vitamin offers something for you.

ACEVIVI Natural Facial Cleansing Oil Anti-Aging Deep Cleansing Oil Useful Eye Makeup Remover 5.3 Fluid Ounces-120ml,5.0,"This water-soluble cleansing oil cleans gently, but very thoroughly.  I wondered about the water-soluble claim, so I tested it by adding water to a small puddle of oil in the palm of my hand.  It immediately dissolves into the water and creates a white liquid.  Washing my face with that white solution left my face and my hands soft, smooth and squeaky clean.

This oil is meant to be applied onto a cotton pad and the pad used to wipe off makeup.  I find that technique works very well for clingy eye makeup.  I don't use heavy foundation, so I don't need an oiled pad to wipe it off.  But after removing my eye makeup, I like to work a bit of oil onto the rest of my face, then apply water as I work it around my face.  It is a very effective way to clean your face.

"Sea Algae Exfoliating Scrub And Sea Algae Hair Mask - With Vitamin C, CoQ10 And Alpha Lipoic Acid. Sea Algae Best Facial Scrub Gently And Effectively Removes Dead Skin Cells. Replenishes Vital Nutrients For Natural, Radiant And Glowing Skin and Hair.",5.0,"When I first received this jar of exfoliate and scrub, I used it as a ""stand-alone"" product.  I used very wet hands, just a bit of scrub and not too much pressure.  It's great:  Not too harsh/particles not too large or sharp; fragrance is un-assuming and very pleasant, and my skin feels so soft, with great buoyant texture after I've rinsed and patted dry.

I don't feel the need to use it more than a few times a week--definitely not every day.  When I do use it, I still feel the need to use my usual Deep Clean facial gel cleanser.  Always looking for a way to speed things up and get in and out of the shower quickly, I happened to hit upon a practice that seems to work superbly for me:  Now, when I feel the need for a bit of scrub--when my gentle gel cleanser needs a boost--I wet my face and my hands, dip out a bit of this scrub, then pump my gel cleanser on top of it.  I work it all onto my face together.  Pretty amazing results, and just what I need a few times a week.

"Dead Sea Mud Mask For Face And Body - Natural Dead Sea Minerals Dead Sea Mud Mask - For Clear, Smooth, Radiant, Younger-Looking And Unblemished Natural Skin Health.",5.0,"I'm really enjoying this mud mask.  It is one of the thinner mud masks that I've used, and I like the way it slides on so easily.  I like the feel of the very fine grit on my face.  I am of the opinion that from the moment I apply it, to the moment I remove the last smug of it from my face:  It is working.  Believing what I read about the mineral content of Dead Sea mud and the documented results of the skin tests that have been conducted over the years, I also believe that this mud mask is working beyond the time I remove it from my face.

I can feel the ""zing"" of the action of the minerals on my skin.  I can feel a tingle and a sweet heat on the more delicate areas of my skin..

When I rinsed it off, I worked the mud with its fine, sandy, abrasiveness, into my skin in areas that usually cause me problems:  On my cheek bones, in the hollow underneath my cheek bones, and on the sides of my mouth and in the area between my lower lip and chin.  I am sure it sloughed off some dead skin--I saw it.

When I patted my skin dry, I noticed that my pores were very tight.  That is a good thing.  Then I patted on my witch hazel toner and then my favorite stem cell serum (also from Elrique).

Minerals in the Deep Sea mud are absorbed into the skin while it is on my face, so I leave it on for a good 25 minutes.  (In Coastal Texas, humidity prevents the mud from totally drying and cracking.)  The minerals in the mud stimulate blood circulation.  I've read that documented testing proves that the mud helps with acne and psoriasis.  Magnesium in the mud helps hydrate the skin  and reduces inflammation.  Amazingly, the mud also lessens the depth of wrinkles.

Nth Degree Smoothing Argan Oil and Keratin Collection Shampoo 13.5 oz. &hellip;,5.0,"I've been using this for a few weeks now and I am really liking what it is doing for my hair.  For reference, I have waist-length color-treated hair that I shampoo every day.  It gets a little dry and I live in Georgia so it is humid.  I get a lot of frizz.  This has done a great job at controlling frizz without weighing my hair down.  I do still need to use a detangler and a bit of hair oil afterwards, but as far as a shampoo's contribution goes, I am quite happy with this one.  It gets my hair clean after workouts, too.

Here is the ingredients list since I didn't see it on the product page:

Water, Coco-Glucoside, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Coco-Betaine, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Polyquaternium-10 Parfum, Grape Seed Oil, Boswellia Carterii Oil, Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Phenoxyethanol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Keratin, Hydroxypropyl Guar.

This does contain sulfates, so some people may want to avoid using it on color-treated hair.  It has not stripped any color from my hair thus far (mine is naturally light and I dye it black).  Because of the sulfates, it lathers nicely.  It also rinses out cleanly without leaving residue.  And, it is particularly good at getting excessive oils out of my hair (like when I experiment with new hair products and go overboard).  So I am happy.

This does not have artificial dyes, which is nice.  It does have fragrance but it doesn't honestly bother me too much.  I find it pleasant enough and it doesn't stick around for long.  Once you rinse, the fragrance is basically gone.  This hasn't irritated my scalp at all.

Please note that this retails in the 13.5 ounce size new for around twelve bucks (and often goes on sale), so do some comparison shopping before you commit to a purchase.  In the end, though, I am at least as happy with this as I am with some much pricier shampoos so I'm glad I gave it a try!",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,5.0,5.0,4.0

"ZeroShop(TM) Empty Clear Spray Bottles / Portable Refillable Fine Mist Sprayer Bottles for Cleaning Products,Beauty Treatments / Pack Of 3 (Colors may Vary)",5.0,"These are handy to have.  I keep one by my air plant for misting it periodically.  I keep one in the bathroom for cosmetics experiments (doing things like mixing tea tree oil with different toners).  And I put mostly water and a few drops of essential oil in the third.  I shake this up and then spray on bedding, furniture, etc. -- whatever I want to smell a little better.  These work for all of those applications.

The spray doesn't travel terribly far from the bottle, just a couple of inches.  But it's about what you'd expect from a bottle this size (they're pretty small, around an ounce).  Because of their size, they won't work well for cleaning.  But for cosmetics and similar applications, they're quite good.

Please note: all three of mine were clear with pink sprayers, although the photo shows three different colors.  I don't particularly care, but I figured I would pass that information along.

PanDaDa 25 Pcs White Mini Mask Spatula Scoop Disposable Makeup Plastic Spoon,5.0,"The one thing Korean and Japanese skincare and makeup products do that American companies don't is include these little spatulas in with their creams, lotions, and potions. It's a freaking great idea. You aren't gooping up your manicure by sticking your finger in the jar, and more importantly, you aren't contaminating the products even if you just washed your hands.

I bought a pack of 25, which will serve for eternity since they are thick, sturdy and perfect for endless reuses (you can throw them in a small mesh bag and run them through the dishwasher if sterilization is important to you.)

Another thing they work great on is samples. If you get a lot of samples (I do) and some come in a jar, the samples will last a lot longer since you'll bet getting a precise amount out of the container for your needs. No waste, and no mess! Oh, and I received the spatulas from China in less than two weeks, so it was definitely worth the wait for the price.

Our Aloe Is Rich In Vitamins A, E, C, and B Vitamins Which Nourish The Skin - **The Aloe Vera is grown and bottled in the USA &amp; Is Certified Organic By The Texas Department Of Agriculture**",5.0,"I received this product at a reduced price and was eager to try it and review it. I have always used the blue, thick Aloe Vera gel. It was goopy and sort of like Jello. Last year, I saw it in clear which was nicer than the fake blue stuff but still had a strange thick, jelly-like consistency. My husband sunburns constantly even with super high SPF on so we have Aloe Vera on hand all the time. It's also great for minor burns, cuts, scrapes and all sorts of things. This large bottle has 16 ounces of pure Aloe Vera in it. There are just a few inert preservatives and an ingredient to help the  gel coat the skin better.

The gel isn't really a gel but more like a serum. It is yellowish in color, very pale, and transparent. When I first poured some out (see photo), I couldn't imagine how it could do the job of soothing skin and actually absorbing into skin but but I was wrong. This gel is so much nicer to work with than the thick, jelly type. It immediately absorbs and isn't greasy at all. There's no tacky feeling or, really, any sign that the gel is on the skin at all. But you will feel it soothe. I went to a graduation party the other day and both my husband and I inadvertently got a bit of sunburn, him much more than I. We both used this gel to sooth and cool the areas and it worked so well. My husband, who was a devoted Aloe Vera blue jelly user, loves the consistency of this product and how it just applies and dries with absolutely no wait time and no stickiness or greasiness. It immediately soothes and makes skin feel better.

I even took my make up off with it last nigh! I used some on a cotton round and it did a great job and left my face feeling soothed and clean. There are a ton of uses for Aloe Vera and this brand is even more versatile than the thick, goopy stuff. I truly like it more than any brand I have tried and I really didn't expect to. I thought I would hate it, to be honest, but I am a convert. I am already planning to buy more since we use it year round and like to have it on hand. Give it a try. You will get rid of a lot of the extra chemicals and thickeners and get more Aloe Vera for your money. Plus the formula is perfect for applying and going with no wait time for drying or for the stickiness to pass. Very, very good stuff that is somewhat unconventional as far as consistency but once tried, I can't imagine many people wanting to switch back to the jelly stuff.",A331BHAR0TRLWT,5.0,5.0,4.0

"Aromatherapy Serenity Essential Oil Blend 15ml - Good Night Blend, Best for Diffuser by Tropical Holistic",5.0,"&nbsp;This review is for the Serenity Essential Oil Blend by Tropical Holistic.

This is a unique, calming blend of essential oils that is guaranteed to create a tranquil, pleasant atmosphere wherever you may diffuse it. With a promise like that, how could I not run to test this product and see if it delivered?

I put 10 drops of the quality, thick oil into my diffuser and got to humidifying my space. Within roughly 10 minutes even though I was on edge all day due to annoying x-boyfriends, screaming children playing outside on the street and telemarketers that won't stop harassing me, my wind wandered to the far tropical reaches of Hawaii and brought immediate calm and wellness to my overall demeanor and presence.

The scents packed into this one magical vial are lavender (calm, stress relief), clary (Blood pressure regulator), Sage (Anti-inflammatory), Marjoram (calming), Petitgrain (relief from depression, anxiety and stress) and Ylang Ylang (relaxation). This creates the perfect blend of calming and soothing oil perfect to diffuse into your environment anytime you are feeling high strung. The aroma is woodsy, sweet and elegant all at the same time. This would be a great scent to keep in your library of essential oils or to gift to someone you know could use such a therapeutic, marvelous blend.

Wavertree &amp; London Beach (8 bars) -Triple-milled (twice) Shea Butter soap Bar -Rich &amp; Creamy Lather,5.0,"Wow, Simple Scents Australia really know their packaging.  It is gorgeous, enough to make this soap gift-worthy.  The bar itself is a plain rectangular brick, but the scent is something to die for.  Whoever thought I'd like beach scent?  I've been to the beach, but I never knew it could smell this good.  I'm never going to like my local beach again, because it doesn't smell like the beach in this soap.  This is a dream beach, the kind of beach I want to wake up in.

I've been using this soap every day for a couple of weeks and the bar lasts and lasts.  The scent isn't quite as strong as it was initially, or maybe I'm used to it, but I bring it up to my nose every time I shower just to get a whiff of beach.

"VIIcode T2O2.5 Oxygen Eye Cream For Dark Circles and Wrinkles - Reduces Puffiness, Crow's Feet, Fine Lines and Bags",4.0,"I'm in my mid 50's and my eyes are definitely showing aging, so I was hopeful when offered one box of VIIcode free in exchange for an unbiased review. As the title says, the results are not instant, but by Day 6 they were visible (please see my photos showing the difference).

The eye cream definitely does a good job moisturizing my eyes, and I used it above and below them. As you can see, the eye cream didn't do much for the puffiness above my eyes. This leads me to believe that the eye cream needs the pads to work its magic. I took before and after pictures, shown side by side. But comparing the two, I could see the puffiness is definitely reduced by Day 6. I don't see much difference in the tiny crows feet at the outer corner of my eyes. I probably would have with continued usage if this were more affordable.

I do love the cooling feeling I that I experienced immediately after applying the pads under my eyes each evening. I also discovered, if I replace the film on the eye pads (the film is what keeps the pads from drying out), I can get one more use out of each pad (even experiencing the same cooling sensation the second night).",A16AXQ11SZA8SQ,4.0,4.0,4.0

This is basically a starter kit since it contains all the basics you need to get started including finger nail clippers, a small, metal emery file, 1 large and 2 small nail files, 2 cuticle sticks, manicure gloves and a basic travel pouch. The cuticle sticks are splinter free and have both beveled and pointy ends; the nail clippers are well made but not the sharpest I have ever used so I would recommend only using on fingernails, the files are thick and have coarse and fine surfaces; the gloves are soft and made of cotton but a little on the small side so would be better suited to smaller hands; the metal emery file has a plastic handle and a stainless steel file surface and my favorite item in the set and the travel bag is just a basic pouch that serves its purpose.  I would purchase this set mainly for travel or to give to my daughter but I would purchase a separate storage bag to keep or gift the set in.

Tara Smith Base Coat Serum,5.0,"I am kind of iffy on hair serums a lot of the time.  Many of them are too thick and I end up with oily clumps of hair.  This one is actually different.

I am not totally sure of how this is supposed to be used (I got it in a subscription box, I didn't go seeking it out).  But what I typically do at night is shampoo and condition my hair, then apply a bit of hair oil at the roots and detangler throughout the length.  I let it air dry.  Then I would use a dry oil or similar product the next morning.  I used this in place of the dry oil.  I took two of the tiniest pumps, rubbed them around on my palms, then gently patted/worked this through my hair.  I brushed my hair after that.

And I tell you, my hair looked really nice after using this.  Frizz is down (even at the ends), flyaways are down, but my hair still seems lightweight and flowing (and there are no clumps).  There is also some nice shine.  I did not find this too sticky and even though it looks thick, when I rubbed it between my palms, it warmed up (it contains some natural oils so this is not surprising) and was easy to distribute.  I did not notice much of a scent, maybe a little.  It is clear in color and not watery.

For reference, I have waist-length color-treated hair (I dye it black, so I really like the shine this product provides).  It is Caucasian textured and kind of halfway between wavy and straight.  I can't speak for all hair types, but this works really well with mine.  It is very easy to get just the amount you want out of the container, so little is wasted.  This is also vegan and free of parabens, phthalates, glycols, and artificial fragrances and dyes, if any of those are important to you.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,5.0,5.0,4.0
Set of 20: HBY8482; Solid Stretch Knot Pony Elastics Ponytail Holders,5.0,"I have really long and thick hair.  I love to wear it down, but it gets so hot and I always end up throwing it up in a bun or pony tail.  When I do this I am constantly breaking my pony tail holders.  Most pony tail holders are not for thick hair, they are for normal hair.  I finally found strong pony tail holders that don't break and hold my hair without damaging it.  I completely love this Set of 20 Solid Stretch Knot Ponytail Holders by HBY.

You do get 20 ponytail holders, mine came in a velcro holder which is nice cause it keeps your ponytail holders in place.  They are 2"" in diameter and stretch really well and nicely.  If you have thick hair, these will work so nicely in your hair.  It will hold your hair and you don't have to worry about the elastic ruining your hair.

These ponytail holders do not get tangled in my hair when I take it out either.  Now I know that it might be a little expensive, but these are hands down the best ponytail holders that I have used.  They are made well and the best quality.  I would pay this price over any chepo ponytails that I have to buy over and over.  I completely recommend these a 100 percent!

My hair is super thin and I have issues with hair ties slipping and loosening as I go through my day, but that was Not my experience with these HBY Elastic Ponytail Holders.
They Stayed In Place until I Removed them Without Issue.
I love that these HBY Hair Ties did Not get Tangled in my hair!
They offer a Lot of Stretch, so even when Wrapped Multiple Times around my ponytail, they were Easy to Remove without pulling out my hair in the process.
Besides actually putting my hair in a pony tail for the day, for testing purposes I placed one of these 2"" Elastic Ponytail Holders around the outer edge of a 3 1/2"" wide drinking glass. There was Not even a hint of stress on the ends where they meet the Plastic Bead!
Perfect for Super Thick or Super Thin Hair alike!

"It Works Best Natural Stretch Mark Scar Removal Cream and Skin Repair by Royal Dead Sea, Moisturizer with Supports Collagen Production During/After Pregnancy or Weight Loss, Therapy Remover (4.05 oz)",4.0,"I do have some stretch marks on my thighs and my breasts (surprisingly none on my belly) mostly from the twin pregnancy and more from the weight gain.  While they usually do not bother me, they do make me self conscious during a swimming season.  The texture of my skin over the stretch mark area is not smooth anymore, so I do not believe a cream would make them completely disappear but I hope that it might make them fade and become less noticeable.  I just got another cream from Royal Sea recently and was so impressed with it, so I ordered this cream as well.

I received Royal Sea promptly and it was packaged in a heavy dark glass jar with a heavy plastic lid tightly wrapped in a bubble wrap.  Unfortunately, despite the protection, the lid was cracked when I received it.  The jar was sealed.  The cream itself is white and has a medium consistency.  I love the scent very much!  It smells like a blend of essential oils with ylang ylang being the most prominent.  The cream was easy to apply and was absorbed quickly and completely without leaving a greasy residue.  There was no stinging or any irritation upon the application.  I have been using this stretch cream for a few days now but I believe it is unreasonable to expect any noticeable changes in such a short period, especially for the old stretch marks.  I think it will take at least weeks and probably a few jars of cream to see any difference.  I am going to continue using it and will update my review if I see any changes in my stretch marks.

Depending on how you cut them, there are 90+ Easy To Apply Tattoos in this package and Each One will last 4-6 Days with proper application.
You can Shower and Swim without worry, as they will remain in place for the suggested time frame until you remove them.
The Average Length of the Wrist and Ankle Tattoos is 7 7/8 "" and vary in Width.
Metallic Tattoo did think to include a few that are shorter in length, but the longer ones can easily be shortened if needed.
There are also Several  ""Single Piece""  Tattoos of various sizes, which can be placed on a shoulder, ankle or just about anywhere you desire!
Each Sheet comes packaged in it's own Plastic Sleeve to store them until you are ready to cut out the next one.
Application Instructions are printed on the Back of Each Sheet, as well as on the Cardboard Topper by which the sheets are stapled together for shipping.
Putting one on is Super Simple!
Make sure your skin is free of oils and makeup.
Select Which Tattoo you wish to apply and Remove the Clear Protective Top Sheet.
(Take Care not to cut into a nearby tattoo's outline when cutting out the one you are going to apply)
Carefully Position and Press the Tattoo *Picture Side Down* Onto your Skin and Hold a Wet Cloth against the Paper Lining of the Tattoo while you apply a slight amount of pressure until the entire paper backing is Fully Wet.
(For Best Application, It's Very Important to make sure the Complete Paper Backing is Thoroughly Moist, but not dripping wet).
Wait at least 30 Seconds, then Slowly and Gently Peel off the Paper Backing from your skin.
The Tattoo will look even better if you gently rinse it with water after applying.
I love how the Metallic Tattoos Sparkle and Glimmer. The Colors are Bright and Beautiful!
Removing the Tattoos is as easy as applying them.  Simply saturate a cotton ball or paper towel with Baby Oil and press it on the tattoo for about 1 minute.  The Baby Oil will allow the tattoo to be rubbed off completely with ease.
At 60+ years old, getting a real tattoo is not on my agenda, so I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to receive these Metallic Tattoos at a reduced cost in exchange for testing and review.

Nth Degree Smoothing Argan Oil &amp; Keratin Hair Mask 6.8 fl. oz.,5.0,"I mostly bought this because it was on sale and I was looking for a hair mask.  I had never actually heard of the brand before.  As it turns out, this has been wonderful for me, and I will definitely be sampling their other products.

Here are the ingredients, since I didn't see them on the product page:

Water, ceteareth-10, dimethicone/silsesquioxane copolymer, grape seed oil, shea butter, argan oil, peg-4 sorbitan stearate, glyceryl stearate, cetrimonium chloride, Boswellia carterii oil, hyaluronic acid, octyl methoxycinnamate, parfum, hydroxypropyl guar, phenoxyethanol, keratin

This has silicones in it, if you are avoiding those.  As it happens, silicone-containing products are quite nice for my hair, especially with controlling frizz, so that doesn't bother me.  This does also have some natural oils like grapeseed, shea butter, and argan oil, and all three of those have generally been quite good in my hair as well.  (I shampoo every day, which can strip oils from the hair, but this helps add some back!)

Please note this is not a vegan product; keratin can only come from animal sources and most of the hyaluronic acid used in industry is a byproduct of poultry processing.

This doesn't have a strong scent, but the scent I can detect is pleasant.  This is so easy to spread throughout my hair and it rinses out cleanly and without leaving residue.  I can actually get by with using much less than my initial instinct because of the texture, which would make this container last longer.  This product is supposed to be for normal to chemically-treated/damaged hair, and I have been dyeing my hair for over 20 years, so it is definitely chemically-treated.  (For reference, I have waist-length, basically straight, color-treated, Caucasian-textured hair.)

Anyway, I use this twice a week.  The next day after use (since I shower at night), my hair is soft and smooth and shiny and manageable, and I have very little frizz and few flyaways.  That is exactly what I am looking for in a hair product, so I'm happy.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,5.0,5.0,4.0

Strong High Quality Nail Art Designs / Patterns Stamp / Stamping / Stamper Tool With Easy To Clean White Rubber Head By VAGA,5.0,"This is a great stamper at a great price point.  It has the squishiness of the Pueen marshmallow stamper but it is not nearly as tacky so you don't have the problem of the stamper head sticking to the nail while applying the stamp and coming out of the holder.  It had a very glossy finish when I received it and did not pick up images well.  I used a cotton pad to massage the head with some acetone and viola; it picked up all the fine lines beautifully.
Below I have pictured a mani I did with it and some swatches to show it picked up the fine lines well.  Excuse the little missing parts, that was my scraping not the stamper.
The stamper is lightweight, easy to hold (as it has two finger indents in the handle) and compact so it is easy to store.  My nails are not super long or short but I had plenty of room to spare with this stamper head for larger images.
I wish I had started with this stamper, it would have made my initial journey into stamping much easier!!! Love it!",AML9BBDXHJFFM,5.0,5.0,4.0
Hyaluronic Acid Serum for All Skin Types 1.7oz Moisture Hydration Advanced Rejuvenation Formula Antioxidant 50ml By Evassence,5.0,"IVE BEEN SEEING LOTS OF ARTICLES AND POSTS ON HYALURONIC ACID SERUMS AND CREAMS IN MAGAZINE ARTICLES, ON LINE, ON TELEVISION, AND ON BLOGS, SO I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY AND IM ABSOLUTELY AMAZED WITH THE RESULTS THAT I GOT!

AT THIS POINT IVE TRIED A FEW DIFFERENT PRODUCTS! THIS BEING MY THIRD, HYALURONIC ACID SERUM PRODUCT. I AM ON DAY 12 OF USING A HYALURONIC ACID SERUM PRODUCT, AND DAY 4 WITH THIS PARTICULAR VITAMIN C. THIS IS WHAT I HAVE DONE, I STARTED OFF USING THE SERUM ONLY ONCE A DAY TO SEE IF I ACTUALLY SEE RESULTS, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT AGREES WITH MY SKIN AS WELL. AFTER 5 DAYS OF USING IT MY SKIN HAD NOTICABLY BOUNCED BACK UP SO I INCREASED MY DAILY USAGE UP TO TWO TIMES A DAY, I WOULD APPLY IT IN THE MORNING BEFORE GETTING DRESSED AND AGAIN AT NIGHT BEFORE BED. IM A MOM OF 5, SO I DO NOT HAVE A SET SHOWERING SCHEDULE, I THROW ONE IN WHEN I CAN, SO OBVIOUSLY WETHER IT WAS MORNING OR NIGHT I APPLIED THIS HYALURONIC ACID SERUM AFTER MY SHOWER.

THIS HYALURONIC ACID SERUM IS CLEAR LIKE IN COLOR AND HAS A THICKER SERUM TEXTURE. I LOVE THAT IT DOESNT RUN COMPLETELY ALL OVER THE PLACE ONCE I PUMP IT INTO MY FINGER TIPS.

Tattify Donut Nail Wraps - It's Worth the Calories! (Set of 22),5.0,"I adore this brand of nail wraps. They create many amazingly cute designs, they are an excellent value, they last, and they are easy to apply. The only drawback to this brand is that they are a little difficult to take off the plastic.  I recommend using the pointy end of the wood rod they include in the set, then when up are able to life off a small corner, flip the wood stick to the other side to take off or use tweezers.  Then put on nail, smooth them on, file excess and remove, then place a clear coat over the top to create a more ""polish"" look.  Also, if you have short nails, you may want to trim a bit of the pink sprinkle of the donut so you can see the donut. Because my nails are short, I only have a tiny bit of the donut showing. I am so glad I found this brand!",A34B7GT56TE4CZ,5.0,5.0,4.0
"Svelta Luxe Coffee &amp; Raw Sugar Body Scrub / Reduce Appearance of Cellulite and Stretch Marks / Long Lasting Hydration / Deep, Intense Exfoliation / Invigorating with Natural Oils and Organic Sugar",3.0,"I wasn't a huge fan of this - I honestly thought it would be coffee scented (like Lush's ""Cup of Coffee"" body mask/scrub) but rather it has a very off-putting scent to me - just a heads up that this does NOT smell like coffee. More like a chemical mixture gone wrong.
There was also way more oil in this scrub than I expected which left me feeling greasy (not hydrated or moisturized), and I'm not really a fan of that. Add to all that the fact that this made a huge mess in my shower and you can see why I only gave this 3 stars.

So basically when using this you need to accept the fact that you *will* be scrubbing your tub/shower afterwards. It leaves a ton of ""grounds"" or whatever all over the tub, as well as a greasy residue. It melts into a brown sludge which stained my grout.

This was not worth the price by any means and I have found much better scrubs for a fraction of the price.",A1M04H40ZVGWVG,4.0,3.0,4.0
"Svelta Luxe Coffee &amp; Raw Sugar Body Scrub / Reduce Appearance of Cellulite and Stretch Marks / Long Lasting Hydration / Deep, Intense Exfoliation / Invigorating with Natural Oils and Organic Sugar",5.0,"Every coffee-a-holic knows the secret to delicious Arabic and Scandinavian coffees...Cardamom!

Coffee body scrubs are quite popular now, and this brand ups the ante with a dash of cardamom. The slight camphor of the spice blends with the coffee in this skin product as nicely as it does in the beverage.
Gentle exfoliation is provided not only by the raw sugar, but also the coffee. Many people use coffee scrubs in conjunction with a weight loss program, claiming that the coffee helps tighten and tone skin. Personally, I think toning has more to do with fitness and diet, but this does make skin feel amazingly soft and smooth. It has even been great on hands and feet as well as other parts of the body.
Just be careful in the tub as it can make surfaces slippery after rinsing it off.

Ultimate Toning and Firming Body Applicator 2 Body Wraps,5.0,"These are now my go to wraps for skin tightening. This product makes me lose inches by tightening my lose skin, not making me lose fat.

Every time I use these wraps every few days, I lose 2-4 inches in my waist. The results last around 36 hours, and are not permanent. I have loose skin from having a baby, and this product does a good job at making my skin tighten back into place as well as make me look slightly thinner. The gel does not irritate the skin. I do these wraps during the day because I want to drink tons of water and flush out the toxins that it's drawing out of my body through urinating. The wraps fit across my whole midsection and around my love handles, up to my ribs and down to my lady area. It can be cut to use in multiple areas.

In my photo, I am the one in the Bikini top. Instead of the skin being saggy, the skin is tightened to my body as close as possible. This is 12 hours after use.

Curl-ease Towel for Curly Hair Pink,5.0,"I love the Curl-ease for drying my hair!!  I have 3c 4a curls and in my opinion this is perfect!!  Curl-ease takes out  the perfect amount of moisture and leaves in what my hair needs.  I have tired the Deva Towel and other microfiber towels as well as tee shirts and my hair is left with halo frizz as the micro fiber takes out too much water and the tee shirt is hit or miss.  With the  Curl-ease it is so simply, after putting in leave in conditioner and my styler on wet wet hair and giving my curls a shake I wrap my hair with the curl ease and leave on for 10 to15 minutes. After I am dressed I take it off, give my curls a shake and viola perfect curls every time with NO halo frizz!  I can choose to diffuse if I want but I always air dry as my hair is just damp.  This towel takes the drips away without removing to much water.  I love it better than tee shirts which work Ok but sometime can give my hair a little frizz and are restricting due to having the hole at the top.  The Curl-ease is the perfect size for long or short hair and certainly better than microfiber.  Curl-ease is #1 drying towel in my opinion!!",A1PGXH95LTH5MN,5.0,5.0,4.0

"Clinically Proven Anti Aging Eye Cream Gel | Advanced Firming Formula Targets Wrinkles, Dark Circles, Puffiness, Under Eye Bags &amp; Crows Feet | with Bioskinup for up to 71% Improvement | All Skin Types",5.0,"I generally don't like to review eye creams and items like this because you really have to use a product like this for an extended amount of time to see how it really works.  This is not formulated to give instantaneous results and you really cant use it or a few days and say oh this is fantastic!  When I was approached to review this the company was more than willing to give me as much time as I needed to properly use and review this product and that really impressed me so I decided to give it a shot.

Ive had a big problem with under eye circles and bags lately due to my erratic sleep schedule and other issues.  I don't have a huge problem with wrinkles or crows feet yet, but any improvement with the dark circles under my eyes was going to be a plus for me.  Ive been using this product for approximately 4 weeks.  I try to use it in the morning and at night, but Im not the best at removing my makeup, so its really been more in the morning.

I took three pictures, one at the beginning, one half way, and one today  I definitely feel like theres been significant improvement with under eye puffiness and dark circles.  Im definitely using less concealer than before, and I feel like my under eye area is tighter than it was before.  I think if used consistently you will definitely get results with this stuff, but understand that it does take a few weeks to really see results, it is NOT instantaneous.

"intensive serum for wrinkles extra firming serum face and neck, micro-lifting, elastin and collagen support, increases elasticity, instant tightening cooling",5.0,"The packaging on this product is excellent. It came boxed with ingredients and other information listed on the panels. The serum is contained in a frosted glass pump which helps protect active ingredients. The serum itself is a thin textured and lightweight. When applied to clean skin, you feel an instant cooling sensation (there's no peppermint or menthol listed, so I'm not sure what is causing it) and a mild tightening effect. This is nothing like those instant ""face lift solutions"" that just pull your skin taut. It's mild, but I think detectable. The serum feels like it absorbs instantly. There is a very soft, subtle, vaguely powdery floral scent to it which dissipates quickly.

I'm not sure what kind of long term effects this might have but I will say my skin just looks better and feels better and other skincare products and makeup apply very easily on top. This serum does contain glycerin and a silicone derivative which probably help with how the product feels on the skin. Active ingredients are interesting and ones that I've not seen much before in skincare including; Scutellaria baicalensis root extract which stimulates the skin and increases elasticity and Sorghum juice  which has a micro-lifting effect on the skin. It also contains liposomes which relaxes and inhibits the uncontrolled contractions of facial muscles. As with most skincare that promises a lot, I'm not sure that this will do what it says long-term but short-term I'm very happy with the results of the product and how it makes my skin look.",A3S5FRDKD52VBG,5.0,5.0,4.0

I have thinner hair and am a huge promoter of another wet/dry brush so I am comparing it to that brush.. What I really like is it does give my hair body when using it to tease my hair. Better than any brush or comb I have used. It's really quite fabulous for teasing and adding volume. It's a cute brush love the rainbow bristles as well  The mirror is an added bonus to look at my hair, or makeup..

What I don't like about it is it's a little too rough for my thin hair. Dry it easily detangles but wet it seems a little more rough and pulls much more hair than my other brush.  Maybe I am losing hair anyways but it seems a little rough for my thin hair. Overall I think its a great brush, especially if you have thicker hair you might really enjoy it. For now I will use it for adding body and love the mirror !!

The challenge has been finding something to wear on my lips at the beach - the typical spf lip balms are clear or nearly clear. So I finally broke down and bought like $100 worth of all the brands I could find of lipsticks with SPF - in colors that I could only hope and guess were cool red/berries based on their names and the phones online.

The only two that were truly a luscious cool-red based color were the Avon brand - the Berry Cute (a very nice pure bright cranberry leaning a little towards fuscia-purple but not too much) and Avon Revenge -- a darker cabernet-raspberry - dark but still ""clear"" and bright, as opposed to having muddy brown aspects.

Every other brand and color were in the red-orange-gold-brown spectrum, regardless of the color names or photos that appeared cool or blue-red.

So after all these years - of trying just about every lip balm and lip stick with spf in the drug stores (and now on Amazon) and finding none that weren't a muddy or orange-y or cantaloupe/salmon hue - I am thrilled to have two lipsticks by the same company no less, that I totally love.  Plus, they go on luscious and smooth and shiny, and feel good and have no taste.  I also tried mixing them on my lips at the same time and got a nice retro-clear-red like the 40's movie stars would wear.  These colors are hard to find in any lipstick, much less one with SPF.

I'm thrilled.",A2EWF2OWK60DJW,5.0,5.0,4.0

Professional Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin C Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Facial And Decollete Smooth Out Wrinkles With Vitamin C + E Tighten Plump Rejuvenate Brighten Skin 1.7 Fl Oz,5.0,"Vitamin C is one of my favorite skincare products. It really is a wonderful all around ingredient; it helps with brightening skin, lightening age spots, stretch marks, and reducing fine lines and wrinkles.

I like the packaging of this product. It is easy to read the information on the label. I love that it comes in a pump dispenser bottle; very hygienic and easy to use! A small pump was enough serum to cover my whole face and some of my neck, which shows that this bottle will last me a long time. The serum itself has a somewhat unpleasant scent, but not anything that bothers me. The scent wasn't noticeable once I applied the product to my face. The serum went smoothly onto my face. As it was absorbing into my skin, my face felt sticky. As the product absorbed into my skin, I feel like it didn't fully absorb into my skin. It left a slight film on my face. The serum doe help to make my face brighter and look more awake in the morning! I have also been using this serum at night, after my toner and before my moisturizer. I have noticed that with regular use of this serum, my skin is brighter and my fine lines are diminishing, which is amazing!

Vitamin C serums can be used for more than just the face. Vitamin C is great for helping with stretch marks and aging hands as well. My mother has always used vitamin C on her hands, and they look very young for her age! I am excited to try this serum for those purposes too!

This serum also has other ingredients that are beneficial for the skin in terms of anti-aging, acne, and redness. Hyaluronic acid and vitamin E are amazing for the skin and anti aging. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",A3OU5DEQVEJC2S,5.0,5.0,4.0
Professional Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin C Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Facial And Decollete Smooth Out Wrinkles With Vitamin C + E Tighten Plump Rejuvenate Brighten Skin 1.7 Fl Oz,5.0,"This is such a great anti-aging serum that provides moisturizing and tightening effect to my face in the short time since I have followed the instructions and included the serum in my twice a day skincare routine. Hyaluronic Acid helps the skin hold in more moisture; Vitamin C helps brighten and even skin tone. Together, they work magic and indeed are the best ingredients to fight signs of aging. This product leaves the skin feeling silky soft and really helps with diminishing the appearance of fine lines. The serum has worked well with my other facial products and  there is no conflicts in over application of ingredients or mixture of fragrances. My skin does not look quite as tired as before and it has continued to look better.

I love the pump dispenser because it is more sterile than taking it out of a jar or regular container. Aside from the convenience of its portability, after reading all of the benefits, I have been adding it to my daily routine and using it prior to my regular moisturizer. The great thing is that because it is so hydrating that I seem to use less of my regular moisturizer. The texture of this product is a clean feeling and lightweight gel. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and does not leave a greasy feel. The serum has no scent or artificial chemical fragrance which I prefer and a little of the product goes a long way. It takes two small squirts onto my finger to get a thin layer covering my face. Once it dries, it leaves my skin feeling absolutely refreshing. It is quite moisturizing as well, so it locks in all the water in my skin and gives it a supple feel all night long.

The serum takes a minute to dry and then I apply my makeup. My foundation goes on very smoothly over it and it seems like I have been applying much less makeup lately. It helps keep my makeup looking smooth and moist longer. I find it work better as a makeup prime than many premium brand makeup primers I have tried. My facial lines around my nose has even seemed less pronounced under my makeup. In just two weeks I have been using the serum, I have noticed that my skin tone has become more luminous and healthier looking. I have not seen any fading of sun spots that I have, but I am hopeful with long term use that they will eventually lighten up. Based on what my experience has been so far, I am confident that with consistency and patience, I will see more progress down the road. This is a wonderful wrinkle smoothing serum and I highly recommend it.

Pomifera Cleansing Conditioner for Fine Hair - 12 oz.,5.0,"I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest unbiased review. I'm an African-American female with kinky coily hair, very particular of my haircare regime. I'm not sure of my exact type, I just know my hair is the type that thrives on moisture. I never go longer than one week without cleansing my strands and sometimes I cleanse every other day. My scalp is very sensitive though with too much shampooing becomes irritated. Co-washing (using conditioner to clean my hair instead of shampoo) has become routine for me and I am constantly looking for conditioning cleansers that perform their best on my hair; maintaining moisture and not stripping natural oils. I found Pomifera Cleansing Conditioner on Amazon and decided to give it a try. Almost immediately I was hooked.  One of one of the main things that caught my attention to this product was the fact that it is Sulfate, Paraben, Gluten, & Phosphate free. Pomifera Conditioner produced teeny-tiny bubbles that seemed to help me detangle my hair as I cleansed it. I used a routine much as I would with a regular shampoo. My hair was clean, was not weighted down, and left with a nice fresh citrus smell. I ABSOLUTELY recommend this conditioner for my natural-haired divas.",AZ4LJ8GSD0PP,5.0,5.0,4.0

Aisilk Hair Cutting Cape Hairdressing &amp; Large Neck Duster Brush set for Hair Cut Hairstylist Design Gown Barbers Salon Make up Cosmetic,4.0,"I've owned a lot of cheap salon capes.  They usually come with the hair styling tools.  Most of the time, they are falling apart right out of the package.  This is an inexpensive cape, but it is the nicest cape I have.  In fact, I went and threw out three of my other cheap capes in favor of this one.  It isn't falling apart.  In fact, it looks pretty good.  I was surprised when I put it on my 12-year-old daughter that the back covered her neck all the way down to the seat.  It doesn't look like it would provide such good coverage from the photo on Amazon's listing.

This cape is thin, lightweight, and breathable.  Hair slides off (unlike another one I own that collects it through static cling).  For younger children, the fit might be too loose around the neck, but it's good for older children and adults.  There's a tiny bit of Velcro, which I used instead of the ties.  They could have made that Velcro larger, but it actually did hold the cape closed.  It performs exactly as expected, so I could focus on cutting my daughter's hair and not worry about whether or not her cape is staying on her.

These are very cute, very affordable decals. I like that each sheet is individually wrapped (though I think the instructions on the packets would be pretty incomprehensible for anyone not already familiar with this technique).  For some reason, though, I'm having a harder time applying these than I have had with other brands of water slip decals. I think perhaps these are thinner. The thinness could be a real plus once the decal is actually in place, because it lies very smoothly on the nail. But for now, I'm fumbling with edges that curl back or fold in on themselves, and wasting time and material in the process This could just be my lack of skill.

So I would say that for someone experienced with this technique these could  be a very good buy. I would not recommend them for beginners. I really wish I could love them, but for now a like is as good as I can do.",A1VUXNNB1NJ2PT,4.0,4.0,4.0

So, how does this one measure?
At first a bit complex, maybe for a literal minute, but quickly, I mean quickly DRIES down to a SOUR, sour, sour residual and not much else for me.
NOT recommending. Vetiver / Vetyver BY Givenchy.

Vetiver is one of those things that requires more work than this company's designer seems to have put into this one.
Not worth a tenth of Guerlain's Vetiver for me.

Wellage Vita Blue in Jection DIY Mask Moisturizing Care,4.0,"This mask is complicated to use.  Please note there really aren't adequate English instructions on the package so I will briefly describe what I had to do to get it working.  First you remove the syringe from the narrow pouch on the left.  There is a blue cap on the end as well as a blue plug *inside* the syringe.  There is serum between the end and the plug, and then the plug blocks a small, dry chamber with vitamin powder.  What you have to do is depress the plunger hard enough to displace the plug so that the serum can mix in with the vitamin powder.  This requires a lot more force than you might think.  (Also be sure to hold the cap on the end in place as you don't want to squirt the serum everywhere.)  But it is doable.  Then you shake and shake and shake to mix the vitamin powder with the serum.  Then you uncap the right chamber and empty the syringe into it (this is also kind of difficult and may take a few tries where you detach, remove air from the syringe, and reattach).  Then you recap the right chamber and really massage things around so the serum covers the mask.  Only then do you open the envelope and apply the mask to your face.

On the one hand, I understand why the vitamin powder is separate.  These things can degrade in solution and you really want the freshest, most intact vitamins to put on your face.  So by mixing at the last minute, you will get that freshness.  On the other hand, this took me about twice as long to use as any other mask because of all the mixing and shaking and figuring things out (I typically only leave a mask on for 10 minutes).  Also, I don't feel that I ever really got the vitamin powder completely dissolved (I still saw some stuff floating in the serum) and although I spent quite some time trying to distribute the serum in the mask pouch, the mask was not evenly wetted (although it was about 90% there).

Once I got this set up, though, it was a nice mask.  It fit my face well and stayed in place.  It did drip a lot on my shirt (as badly as the My Beauty Diary masks, if you are familiar with those).  You may want to wear an old shirt or put a towel under your chin or something, to catch the drips.  I used this in the morning before work and it did not interfere with the application of subsequent steps in my skincare routine; I was also able to put on makeup that morning without issues (I have had some skincare products in the past that interfered with makeup application, so it is also important to note when they don't interfere!).

Ingredients include vitamin C (probably the white powder in the syringe, and a great antioxidant), hyaluronic acid (a carbohydrate polymer that holds onto a lot of moisture and will have plumping and moisturizing effects), aloe vera (another great moisturizer), and snail secretion essence (another good moisturizer).  So, this mask is not vegan (in addition to the snail slime, hyaluronic acid generally comes from fish or poultry processing).  But, because of the aloe and vitamin C, this would be great for use after sun exposure.

I found this moisturizing, soothing, and refreshing.  I may not buy it again just because of the hassle to prepare everything, but it was definitely fun to try once.  (Please note: you can get masks elsewhere for under four bucks apiece; I'm not sure how many masks this listing is for.  Just do some comparison shopping before committing to a purchase.)",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,4.0,4.0,4.0

I can get an image, but not a consistently strong or clear one. I'm afraid this plate is just going to go in the recycling bin.
***************
The designs are so super cute and finely detailed that I almost want to cry that I'm having such a hard time getting good impressions. If I scrape too hard (or not quickly enough), there isn't much polish to pick up. If I scrape too softly there are smears. I'm pretty new to stamping and don't have a lot of basis for comparison, but it seems as if maybe the etching is shallower on this than the two other plates I have. I should note I have just been using regular polish. So perhaps it's time to invest in real stamping polish and see if that makes a difference.

Franks Deals&reg; Makeup Foundation Sponge Blender Blending Puff Flawless Powder Smooth Beauty,5.0,"I wanted to replace my previous beauty blender sponge with a better one. The one I previously had gotten hard, I felt like I have to press into my face too much with the old one. When I got this one I immediately loved it 10 times better than my old hard rock sponge. For the price, it beats the $20 beauty blender any day! it's soft on the skin and it blends my foundation in so well. I would recommend this for anyone with dry skin due to the moisture coming from the damp sponge. It does give me an airbrushed finish! However, it does stain easily like any other sponge, so I like to wash it with a baby soap after every use to help avoid stains and bacterial growth. I also like how this one has an angled side! I can use the angled part for under my eye area, and it really helps the process!! You are going to love this makeup sponge!
*UPDATE*
I used this sponge twice now, and the sponge is still really soft!
It didn't shrink into a hard sponge like my old ones, even after it's completely dried! Very impressed!

"Body Tonique Natural Miracle Skin Cream Lotion, 4 oz.",5.0,"First let me say, I have very dry sensitive acne prone skin in addition to loose skin due to extreme weight loss. This product combined with the Body Toinique Hydration tonic spray has been my holy grail of skin care. It has drawn up my saggy skin like some miracle sent by God & I do not have a double chin or turkey neck as I have lost over 290 pounds. I don't have a single wrinkle on my face at age 40 and my pores are not even visable and my complextion is even and smooth. I have used the Body Tonique product's in combination for 3 years styarting with the classic spray and moving to the rest of the line. This is my single most favorite item. It takes only a pea size amount ater your classic drys and the smell is amazing and has no competition as the classic spray has no scent so it's neutral. This is so light and refreshing not greasy or heavy. I also use it after I shave any part of my body and to treat my hair very curly frizzy hair so it stays tamed which is important when your a fashion and skin care model.  I love that  when I read the ingredients alone it's all organic and natural not to mention all those products seperate would cost me well over the cost of this product and I know because I have tried on my own to make my own skin care and have never been able to but somehow this combination far exceeds the quality I have even paid an embaressing amount of well over $60 for from big department stores with no results, break outs, cloged pores and even skin rash or burns from the excess of essential oils added. Regardless of the season this is my moisturizer after I use my Body Tonique Classic. I am Italian with fair skin and HAD dry, itchy, red sensitive skin with acne. But the best part is if you produce not enough oil or your skin is too oily this  balance's it perfect. My husband is African american and 67 and his is oily. It works wonders for both of us we share the same skin care. Including the amazing lemongrass scented shampoo, conditioner and  body wash that wakes me up in the morning or gives me a calm spa like aroma at night. I have to mention I also no longer have any dark circles under my eyes or on my eye lids and I did before I hated it, I looked like I had a sun burn ring around my eyes but after using the eye cream within just a few weeks it literally faded all together. At this point seeing for me is believing so Im a Body Tonique girl to the MAX now. But what is even more amazing is I mentioned I'm a skin care model and I was not before I started using this skin care line, in fact if you would have told me I would be one I would have lughed at you. But it's true I am now a skin care model for many companies but I never even use their products I use Body Tonique to keep my skin and hair healthy and amazing. Just so you see the results I included my photos of the day before I started using the Classic spray and I posted it on my facebook page for all to see and my now photo and you will see I wear zero makeup and take natural no photo shop or touch up modeling photos. But I love I can buy it on Amazon or on their web site and the list of the various product lines they now have. All I can say is go Tonique I never have to search for skin care products ever again!",A1SCQZYKVCXJ5,5.0,5.0,4.0

Sheer Cover Advanced Nourishing Moisturizer,5.0,"I was excited to try this moisturizer since I was looking for the perfect makeup primer equipped with some level of UV protection for my busy morning routine. Although this is my first encounter with this brand, I must say this is a great face cream under makeup and I am glad that I found exactly what I have been looking for. The first thing I like about this product is that it is fast absorbing without any annoying residues. My makeup goes on smoothly and evenly. I also like and respect at all ingredients and directions easily accessible on the side of the container. I really enjoy the tube design container which I can easily squeeze the exact amount of the cream I want and I find it extremely convenient and portable which can be slipped into my purse wherever I go.

It feels smooth and luxurious when I spread it over my face and neck. I have not experienced any irritation or negative reaction to this cream. Nevertheless, it is gentle enough to apply even under my eyes without any burning or itching sensation which has happened with a lot of beauty products I tried over the years. It also has no scent that I can detect which makes this moisturizer perfect for my skin type and my skin soaks right into this product rather quickly. I instantly love the way it makes my face feel soft and supple on first use and the results over the past week alone have continued to smooth my skin significantly. It sits well under my sunscreen or foundation. My makeup does not shift or move after I put it on.

This moisturizer is pretty amazing that it provides moisture without causing any breakouts. This is by far the best daytime moisturizer that I have ever used not only it provides the basic UV protection and a nice matte finish under my foundation, and it also enhances my makeup giving me a flawless and radiant appearance. This product is such a great find that I will always keep one in my purse or carry-on bag. Highly recommend!

Peripera Rouge Pang Rich Color Lipstick 0.2 Ounce PP02 Some Story To Tell,5.0,"I don't even remember where I got this.  But I like it a lot.  (I have shade PP02.)

It goes on very smoothly and is moisturizing.  It doesn't dry out the lips at all; they stay hydrated for hours.  I do get some color wearing off on drink containers, but that is not so unusual for a lipstick product.

This is a BRIGHT fuchsia color, so PP02 may not be for you unless you are into bold colors.  I love bold lipsticks so this is perfect for me.  (I have pale skin and black hair so I like the contrast and pop of color this provides.)  The finish is not shiny/glossy but not *exactly* matte either.

I have not gotten any feathering.  If that is something you are worried about, you can always use a clear lip liner (I like the one from Lipstick Queen but there are some less expensive options available as well).  This wears well; I am not seeing every flaw in my lips.  Instead, I think my lips look pretty good and because this is moisturizing, I don't have to worry about what the condition of my lips will be at the end of the day.  I do have to reapply periodically but this is pretty common for lipsticks.

I have used a lot of Korean skincare products but now that I have tried some Korean makeup products (like this one), I am finding that I am a fan of those as well.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,5.0,5.0,4.0
Beau Belle Pro Contour &amp; Highlight Palette - Contour Palette - Contouring Kit - Contouring Palette - Contouring and Highlighting Kit - Highlight and Contour - Highlighter Makeup - Contour Kit Powder,3.0,"This isn't a bad product at all. Colors are all completely or very-near matte. For a person with a warm, medium-to-dark skin tone this would probably work beautifully and the price for the varied colors you get is a winner. For a pale, cool-toned complexion... sigh. Well, time to keep looking. There are maybe 2 or 3 VERY pale colors at the top left of the palette that are very pale pinkish-toned off-white, but they are too light to be of use in contouring. May be good in highlighting powders for you if you prefer your highlighting powders to be matte.

It gets a 3-star even though it's nearly all unusable for me simply because, for the price (about $18 when I bought it; price may vary here on Amazon from time to time) the number of colors that DO work for me is just great.",A2EBR70V6P9W0N,3.0,3.0,4.0

Natural Being Skin Toner with Manuka Honey,4.0,"First Impression:
The packaging is generic and nothing special. It comes in a squeezable tube and it is esy to get the desired amount of product you will need. it keeps the product fresh and it is portable so you can take on the go.

The consistency is gel-like but as soon as you massage it onto the skin, it melts and becomes a light water cream but not runny. It is easy to apply and it dries fairly quickly. It goes on clear and it does not irritate the skin. It has a nice cooling effect. It leaves the skin very smooth and soft.
Likes:

  Natural  ingredients
  It contains Manuka honey. I am aware of the many benefits of it which is the main reason I got this toner. I have not seen long term or visible changes in my skin yet but I'll keep you updated.
  The cooling effect
  Anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties
  It is not greasy, oily or sticky. It does feel a bit tacky while it is drying but once it dries it is no longer tacky.
  Light texture
  A provides some hydration. It is not amazing but I am glad that it does not over dry my skin.
  It does not irritate my skin or cause redness
  It has cause me to break out
  It does not leave my skin looking extra oily
  Cruelty free
  Recycle packaging

Dislikes:

  It does not dry out my skin but there had been occasion when I feel that this toner makes my skin feel tight and not very supple.  I think that it is the tightening of the pores but when my skin is feeling dry. I rather use a more moisturizing toner.
  I read the ingredients lists and it lists ""Parfum (fragrance)*"" which is never good for me. I have had bad reactions to added fragrances in the past. This has not irritated my skin but I wish that they did not added it. The fragrance is from natural essential oils but I wish I knew which ones. I can never be extra careful.

Overall Assessment:

* Price Point: 4/5
* Quality/Durability: 5/5
* Need: 4/5
* Recommendation: 4/5
* Overall Assessment of Product: It has some great ingredients and the texture is unique. I love the refreshing and cooling effect and how it makes my skin feel smooth.  I only wish that it was little bit more hydrating. For now, I will continue to use it and I will update this review with new information. I am not in love with it yet so we'll see.

Natural Being Skin Toner with Manuka Honey,5.0,"Of all the products that I have tested over the years this is definitely my first Toning Gel that I have ever tested.  It's a very unique and effective product that I am happy to add to my daily skincare routine.  I think this is the other crucial product that helped get rid of some skin issues that I've been dealing with.
This all natural Manuka Honey & Manuka Oil Toning Gel by Natural Beauty Limited is a lightweight gel that instantly melts into the skin.  It soaks deep into pores and provides a soft finish leaving skin feeling toned and hydrated.  This toner helps clear dead surface skin cells, refines pores and helps stimulate cell renewal.

I did a blog post about my awesome results with the Manuka Oil that helped heal some cystic acne spots that I developed and I think this cleanser is the other product that helped me have such immediate results.  If you haven't read that post you can read it on my blog, GlamRiver.
This gel cleanser 100% natural and is formulated for normal to oily skin and is free from Parabens and other chemicals, artificial fragrances, colors and preservatives.  It's a foaming cleanser that contains active Manuka Honey which is known to help stimulates cell renewal and helps soothe inflamed skin, heal blemishes, balance skin's pH levels and slough away dead skin cells.  It also contains my beloved Manuka Oil which has similar benefits so it's now wonder this worked so well on my oily, problematic skin.
I you are suffering from any kind of skin issues or irritation then I would recommend you get your hands on this Manuka Honey & Manuka Oil Cleanser by Natural Beauty Limited and the Manuka Oil as well.  It's a great natural alternative to using a bunch of chemicals on your skin that can do more harm than good.

Natural Being Anti-Aging Oily Skin Night Cream,4.0,"I was interested in trying this night cream because it claims to be especially formulated for oily to normal skin.

PACKAGING:

The night cream comes in a squeezable tube. I am not a big fan of this type of packaging because as you continue to use it, it becomes harder to get the product out and it can be wasteful. However, this type of packaging is great for traveling. Also, while I am not super impressed with the packaging, it does a nice job at keeping the product fresh.

FIRST IMPRESSION: 

It has a light to medium consistency. It has a yellowish color but it does not stain your skin. It has a light scent and it is creamy. It is easy to distribute and apply. It does not irritate or cause redness. While you apply it it has a almost glossy finish and the skin feels soft but as it dries the skin looks matte and it feels smooth. There is no visible residue.

PERFORMANCE:

After I used it the first time I thought, ""Actually this is nice, I think I will really like it"", but after using it a few more times, I have changed my opinion. It has great benefits and it excels in some areas but in others I am not very impress with it.

I am impress with the quality and its natural ingredients. It feels really nice when you put it on and the scent is not overbearing which is great. It has no parabens or dangerous chemicals. It is cruelty-free. It does not irritate my skin and it does not cause breakouts. It dries very fast which is great for those long days when I can wait to long to go to bed. It does not have a sticky or greasy finish.

I have been using two different serums and they do not seen to get alone with this cream. So I change it to another and the same problem occur. After my serum is absorb into my skin, I apply this cream but it does not go on smoothly. It looks like brush strokes and it is very patchy. At first, I thought that I was applying to much but the results were the same with less product. This is not a big deal since it will dry either way. But it bother me for some reason.

I enjoy how soft and supple my skin feels as soon as I apply it but then it losses that quality and becomes very matte and it is not longer super soft. My face feels a bit stiff. I would not mind much since it might be helping my skin stay firm. Buw when I wake up in the morning my skin does not feel very moisturize which I do not like. Every time I use it, I want to add a sleeping pack on top for moisture.

However, I have to mentioned that while my skin does not feel supple and hydrated in the morning, it is not greasy or oily either. I am not saying the it will remove all of your sebum/oil but it just makes your skin look matte. I give it points for that but honestly, I rather give my skin hydration at night and I do not care much about looking oily.

Natural Being Anti-Aging Oily Skin Night Cream,5.0,"If you've been reading my blog, GlamRiver over the last few weeks then you already know that I've been testing out a skincare line by Natural Beauty Limited and it's no secret that I've been loving all the products.  The latest one and sadly my last....for now....is this Manuka Honey & Manuka Oil Night Cream.
I've been testing out a few heavy night oils over the last couple weeks so I decided to just use this Night Cream on my decollete so I could get a good feel for what I liked about it without it being overrun by other products.
As I expected this is another gem of a product!  While the consistency is a bit thicker than the Day Cream, as it should be, it still absorbs nicely and leaves skin feeling really well hydrated and nourished.  I've been applying this at night right before bed and in the mornings I notice how soft, smooth and maybe even a little more plump my skin looks and feels.
This product contains the Manuka Honey & Manuka Oil which help fight the micro-organisms that cause irritation, help stimulate cell renewal while hydrating and leave skin looking and feeling revitalized.

My eyes water so badly and this coats the front of my contacts to the point I cannot see.  So annoying.  It's a pricey product for it to not stay in place!

Nanacoco Nail Polish Love Black (6 Pieces) Black,5.0,I love it for stamping. Super pigmented and all my stampers pick it up.

Mega Pro 2 Palette 32 Colors Authentic,5.0,"I am participating in a palette panning challenge in an online beauty forum.  This is the palette I picked for this year (I got it back when it was still available at Ulta -- it was an Ulta-exclusive limited edition item at the time and is now sold out there, so if you like it, now is the time to pick it up).

Last year for the same challenge I used Coastal Scents Revealed 2 and I find this Lorac palette is just amazing by comparison.  The darker shadows are much more pigmented than the Coastal Scents palette but it is easy to get just a little on a brush and it is easy to blend these (I have been using the Coastal Scents primer since I have most of a tube of it left; it is sufficient to prevent creasing and migration with these shdaows).

I occasionally get a little fallout but that is usually when I have been too heavy with the brush.  One thing I like here is that if I decide a color is too dark once I put it on, there are a lot of light colors I can brush over it to lighten it up a bit.  It has the effect of increasing the number of shades available to me, and I've gotten some nice layering effects.  The left side of the palette does look like it has a bunch of similar colors, though there are subtle differences if you see it up close (none are pure white and many have soft background colors like pink or tan or yellow).  All of the light shades are good for highlighting around/on the brow bone.  ""Moonlight"" (bottom left) is a great color for brightening the inner corner of the eye.

I'm using the darker colors more than I expected (I'm very pale), probably because they blend so well.  I am even using the dark blue color.  I am not using the top and bottom shadows on the right much (they'd be best as liner colors and I am better at applying pencil liners).  But I have at least tried everything else.  I am liking ""Goji"" (reddish color) and ""Tangerine"" more than I expected, and I am making gold and yellow-tone colors work, which is something I had not previously thought possible.  I like ""Lavender"" and the purple color next to it quite well, also.

Although there are some cool tones available, this palette seems warm to me.  There are no bright pinks and not many greens, and also not as many browns as I might like.  But it is sort of forcing me out of my comfort zone and teaching me to use color combinations I might not have been bold enough before.

The shadow lasts all day for me (over primer) and does not irritate my eyes at all.  This palette does not come with any kind of applicator but I just use eyeshadow brushes and am having no trouble at all.  The pans are smaller than Coastal Scents (Revealed) or Urban Decay (Naked) pans, but there are more colors to choose from as well, so you can create a wider variety of looks.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,5.0,5.0,4.0

"NOTS UV Protection Sun Cream SPF50+ PA+++ - ECOCERT Certified Ingredients, 2.47oz",5.0,"If you have never tried an Asian sunscreen before, you are in for a treat. After reading about Korean skincare from the Charlotte Cho book about K beauty, I began a skincare routine which religiously included sunscreen. The problem is that American sunscreen is awful stuff, sticky, causes breakouts, shiny, and ruins whatever effect you are trying to create by using multiple skincare products and exfoliate her's and serums each day. Why can't American companies create a product that American women want to wear every day? Even the high-end brands use sunscreen ingredients that sit on top of the skin and cause breakouts.

I tried a few different Asian sunscreens, includingBiore KAO JAPAN AQUA RICH Sarasara SPF50+/PA++++ 50g Sunscreen&nbsp;and&nbsp;SKIN AQUA UV moisture Milk SPF50+ PA+++ 40mL New 2016, and overall really like this one because it spreads on smoothly like a cream rather than a watery liquid, but instead of sitting on the skin like American versions, it almost immediately disappears underneath my fingertips to where I can hardly tell I am wearing it at all. There is the tiniest little iridescent shimmer that gives away the fact that I am wearing some manner of mineral sun protection, but it is actually pretty attractive, like the sort of gentle shimmer that you would get from a brightening cream.

This is the second product I have tried from this brand, and I can't even believe how impressed I am with a brand that I've never heard of before. The fact that these are effective, no-frills, fragrance free products that are incredibly good at doing their job makes me so happy. I don't need fragrance out of my toner or sun protection cream, I just need them to work and work well. And that's what these do.

Though I received a sample for review, the positive opinion is my own and I certainly intend to purchase more of this product once I run out.",A2MBLVMVDLHK1L,5.0,5.0,4.0

Yumbutter - Organic Go-Anywhere Superfood Pouch Almond Butter - 7 oz.,5.0,"I got this in a recent Vegan Cuts snack box and I'm a fan.  I usually just use natural peanut butter (the kind you get straight from the grinding machine at Whole Foods) and this has a very similar calorie count (185 calories for 2 tablespoons, which is about exactly what I want for a sandwich).

This has a very smooth texture.  It's almost a little runny so if you pack a sandwich in your lunch, you might find the inside of the sandwich bag a little messy by lunch time.  But it's not too bad.  The pouch is a convenient package for this product -- it's easy to squeeze out and to really get every last little bit.  I like that you can just screw the cap back on and leave this on the counter or in the pantry -- it does not need to be refrigerated.

Although this says to knead it before dispensing, I have forgotten to do that several times now and it has been fine; I didn't really notice any separation or oiliness.

Flavor-wise, I like this.  It is a bit sweet but not overly so.  It still tastes primarily like a nut butter despite the addition of the seeds.  The seeds are well incorporated (none of that gloppiness you often see with chia seeds) and the texture is smooth and non-chunky.  There is a little hint of fruit to it (I guess from the goji berries?).  I don't use jelly with this, but I don't use jelly with peanut butter either.  You could if you wanted to and it would not conflict.

This is full of protein and healthful plant fats.  Here are the ingredients since I didn't see them on the product page:

Organic Almonds, Organic Sunflower Seeds, Organic Ground Chia Seeds, Organic Coconut Sugar, Organic Hemp Seeds, Organic Goji Berry Powder, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Lucuma.

This has 3 grams of sugar but the seeds add some fiber, putting that also at 3 g.  Sodium is very low (less than one percent).  This is vegan and gluten free if either of those are of concern to you.  Please note that it does contain tree nuts (almond and coconut) as well as sunflower seeds, so be on the lookout if you have allergies to those.

Overall, I'm a fan of this.  It's peanut butter sandwich week for lunch for me but I have been using this instead and will continue to do so until the pouch is empty!",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,5.0,5.0,4.0

Givenchy Poudre Lumi&egrave;re Originelle - Soft Powder Radiance Enhancer,4.0,"I've been trying different highlighters and illuminating powders lately.  (I got this as a sample from Choix.)  I don't think this is my favorite (that goes to the Urban Decay Afterglow highlighter) but it is one of my top 2 or 3 along with the Guerlain Meteorite Pearls.

I am super pale, like the lightest foundation shade, so I gravitate towards pink highlighters.  (Neutral ones are often the same as -- or even darker than -- my skin tone.  But pink seems to work.)  I put this on over liquid foundation (right now a NARS one but I am changing those up until I find my perfect fit, as well) and finishing powder.  It blended very well and didn't streak and there wasn't any fallout.  At first, I didn't think it showed up.  But then I stepped back from the mirror and saw a very subtle effect.  I like it, it kind of brightens up my face (I used it on top of my cheekbones) but doesn't make it obvious that I'm wearing a lot of makeup.  So it's good for a more natural look, and it's hard to mess up the application.

This was non-irritating and lasted all day.  I did have to put on a fair amount to get the effect I wanted, but I also rarely finish powders in compacts so I suspect it will last a long time, regardless.

If you are interested in getting this product, I recommend shopping around.  This retails elsewhere for under sixty dollars.  I am definitely considering a full size purchase but I am torn -- using a brush on it would destroy the absolutely beautiful look of the product in the package.

At any rate, I'm happy with the performance and would recommend this as a highlighter especially for people with pale skin.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,4.0,4.0,4.0

Skinfood Organic Coconut Oil Moisturizer,5.0,"I have been using coconut oil for years and I am well aware of its wide range of benefits for the skin, hair and body. I have curly hair so I have also tried and currently use many of the oils included in this oil mixture.

PACKAGING: '''''

The oil blend comes in a well-made and good quality glass bottle with a dropper. The bottle is feels sturdy and the dropper works great.

FIRST IMPRESSION: '''''

The blend is clear and it has a light consistency. A little bit goes a long way. I use them on my face, hands, cuticles, and hair. The oil is easy to apply and it does not leave a sticky residue. It does have a glossy finish as soon as you apply it on the skin. I was disappointed because from the description, I was at the impression that it did not leave a oily residue. But I let it absorbed into the skin for a couple of minutes and the skin did not look as shiny. I have oily skin so I do not need extra shine. I do use oils on my skin because they help the skin so much especially oily skin.

PERFORMANCE: '''''

After I used it on my skin one night, I was amazed the next morning. My skin felt nourish and bright. I continue to apply it every night after my toner and serum and it is a nice addition to my skin care routine.

I have also use it on my hair and it has been loving it. I has a light and not greasy texture and it does a nice job at hydrating my hair.

I also apply one or two drop on my hands before going to bed. I also massage the oil on my cuticles and it is great for it.

So far I have been enjoying the texture and the quality of this blend. It is very easy to use and very versatile.

In terms of its oily finish, if you use more than three drops, it will make you skin have a glossy finish. I would advice you to use less than three drops on the face if you want to avoid an oily look. I use it mainly at night so I add three drops and it makes my skin glow and look healthy. Also, if you have dry skin or prefer a glowing make up look, I would recommend that you add one or two drops of the oil to you foundation. It makes your skin look amazing and healthy.

Skinfood Organic Coconut Oil Moisturizer,5.0,"Wow!  That's the first word that came out of my mouth when I used this Organic Coco+Nut Oil by Skinfood New Zealand for the first time.  To say I am now obsessed with it might be an understatement.
This Organic Coco+Nut Oil is made with a light weight blend of cold pressed Coconut Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Apricot Kernel Oil and Vitamin E.  It delivers instant hydration and is fast absorbing so there is no oily or greasy residue.
Not only is your skin instantly hydrated but it also feels soft and smooth and as added bonus it gives skin a beautiful, healthy glow!  It's pretty fabulous.
The ingredients in this Organic Coco+Nut Oil by Skinfood New Zealand work together to help heal, soothe, repair, nourish, regulate moisture levels and stabilize the natural pH levels in the skin. It really does a little bit of everything and makes skin look and feel amazing!
This oil can also be used anywhere including nails and hair but this one that I would save for your face, neck and decollete.  My favorite way to use this is as a Sleeping Oil.  I apply a generous amount to my face, neck and decollete before bed and in the morning my skin looks revitalized.  Any skin blemishes or irritations are visibly reduced or completely gone.  Dry patches disappear, skin feels hydrated and it even a looks bit younger looking.  LOVE!
Be grateful that the good peeps over at Skinfood New Zealand are sharing their loving products with us on Amazon so there is no need to travel to New Zealand (not that I wouldn't mind!) to get your hands on their fabulous products.  I can't wait to try more!

Skinfood Natural Hand Cream for Dry Skin,5.0,"In the last couple of weeks, I have been in the hunt for a good hand cream. I realized that I take care of my face and body skin but I tend to neglect my hands. I tend to use whatever is at hand. I recently had the chance to try this Nourishing Hand Cream by Skinfood.

FIRST IMPRESSION: 

It comes in a simple squeeze tube. The product comes out easily and it is easy to apply. It has a medium and creamy texture. I feels like a whipped cream. It has a natural scent. I can smell the natural scents of the ingredients such as Aloe Vera, Avocado oil and Manuka Honey. It is not very strong. The application is really nice and it leaves the skin refresh, smooth and soft.

PERFORMANCE:

This hand cream stands out from the few other hand creams that I have tried. From the texture to the finish of the cream. Usually the texture of the other creams are light or runny but in this one is more concentrated. A little bit goes a long way and my hands stay hydrated for longer. The finish is not greasy or tacky like other hand creams. The fisnish is smooth and soft. It does not feel or look oily.

I applied the cream to one side of my hands and the other side with another moisturizer. I asked my family to tell me if them could feel a difference. They told me that they prefer the side with the Skinfood - Nourishing Hand Cream.

In addition, I am really glad that this cream contains many natural ingredients that I have used in the past and I love such as Aloe Vera, Avocado Oil and Manuka Honey.

Apply this every morning and night. My hands have been loving the treatment during the cold days and I keep this with me at all times. Since I use it religiously, I have not experience any cracking or dry skin.

Maybelline Color Sensational Vivid Matte Liquid (40 Berry Boost),5.0,"I got this in an Ulta gift with purchase and I finally got around to trying it out.  I think this may be my favorite liquid lipstick of all time -- and I have tried them from across the cost spectrum (e.g., Julep, Kat Von D, NYX, Tarte, and Stila).

The color is lovely, somewhere a touch lighter than most berries but less bright or vivid than, say, a fuchsia.  (It looks just a little darker on me than what the product image shows.)

The applicator is a standard doefoot applicator (maybe a bit on the large side, but very easy to use).  It picks up enough product at one dip in the tube to cover the top and bottom lips.  This goes on very nicely.  It is instantly matte, and dark enough that if you want to use a lip liner, you can.  I don't have feathering yet, but the texture is such that this could happen on some people.  It has a slight fragrance that I find to be pleasant and that doesn't linger.

But the main thing in favor of this stuff is that it is moisturizing.  A lot of matte lipsticks dry out the lips, and liquid lipsticks are especially bad about this.  But not this product!

Anyway, I'm a fan.  It is so hard to get a matte look without it being drying.  I am going to get these in a whole bunch of colors, I think.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,5.0,5.0,4.0

Kingfansion Nail Art Stamping Stamper Scraper Image Plate Transfer Manicure Tool,4.0,"This is a very nice little stamper. I was able to pick up good images right out of the package.

Pretty much any color polish will show up, and I can look through it for image placement. I like the protective cover that comes with it. I like the sturdy credit card style scraper.
The only drawback is the small size. I couldn't pick up as much image width as I would like without rolling or pressing really hard, and for some images this led to distortion. So that is why I only gave four stars.

"ZesGood Natural Purple Rose Oil Day and Night Stretch Eye Cream for Dark Circles and Crow's Feet, 30g(1.06 fl.oz)",5.0,"I am recovering from eye eczema as a result of the prolonged sun exposure.  The skin under my eyes is extremely sensitive and get irritated quite easily.  I had undereye puffiness right after the sun exposure, but 2 months later, there is no puffiness but there are dark reddish circles under my eyes that look like bruises.  They prompted questions from people implying domestic violence.  Needless to say, I am quite obsessed with eye care products right now.  I tried many by now and ZesGood eye cream was one of them.

It arrived promptly after placing an order and was packaged in a attractive purple bottle with two pumps, one for a day eye cream, the other one for a night eye cream.  This is 2-in-1 eye cream.  It took several presses on the pumps before the cream appeared which is always the case with new products in the pump form.  The day cream is something between a gel and a cream, and the night cream is a true cream.  Both are easy to apply and stay where you put them.  They have thick consistency, white color, and a very light scent, barely noticeable.  I was not able to recognize rose in it, but I do not buy eye creams for the scent, although I have to admit that rose oil was what attracted me to this cream in the first place.  The cream got absorbed quickly and completely without leaving any greasy or sticky residue.  Both day and night versions are incredibly emollient and moisturized my undereye areas wonderfully.  Despite my eyes being extremely sensitive, the creams did not irritate them at all.  It felt really good on my undereye skin.  I did not use them long enough to report whether it is effective against dark circles but based on their hydrating properties I believe they will make a difference.  Each cream is 15 g, which is common for eye care products.  The outside box has both Chinese hieroglyphs and poorly translated English.  The ingredient list is in Chinese, but there are English abbreviations for DMDMZ(?) and EDTA, as well as a Latin name for Shea butter.  Overall, I was very pleased with these creams, and have a good feeling about their long term use.  I was very happy that they are gentle enough to be used on my eyes with eczema.  I received these creams at a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",A2Y771VL7HT81N,5.0,5.0,4.0

I've bought the erase tape and returned it, because I couldn't get it to not look splotchy under my eyes, but that's a common issue. I've found nothing that doesn't look splotchy under my eyes, no matter how I blend it with a brush with the sponge with my finger, just nothing seems to make things look smooth.

[MOGONG DODOOK] Legendary Empress AHA &amp; BHA Collagen Emulsion 200ml,5.0,"I have myself for loving these products.

They are made with shark cartilage. Which is never humanely sourced. I bought them by accident, I didn't know until I bought it. I looked up the items online on a whim later, and found out what was inside.

omg though... it's sooooo amazing on my skin.

I hate myself for loving them haha. I think, I may have to break my vow and keep buying these products.  I mean... I buy everything else humanely sourced, so... it evens out, right? :x

It has AHA and BHA to gently exfoliate the face. It makes your skin SO soft and SO smooth. Use with the toner. Use the toner about 15-30 mins before this, to let it fully absorb, and then use the emulsion with your regular skin routine. These products are amazing, they are so wonderful, they smell like citrus, they have great absorption, they are fantastic. Seriously, fantastic. I use a LOT of Korean skin care products, and these two products, well, actually all the Mogong Dodook products, have been phenomenal on my skin and far out performed everything competing with them. I haven't found a better toner, emulsion, or day or night cream. They are all fantastic. I love them.

It's not humanely sourced. Be warned before you become hopelessly addicted like me. From what I can tell the day/night cream is humanely sourced, it's just the toner and emulsion that has the shark cartilage in it. That seems to be where they got the collagen from, from what I can tell (the site is in Korean)

Check it out for yourself. But this stuff is seriously amazing.

[MOGONG DODOOK] Legendary Empress AHA &amp; BHA Collagen Toner 200ml,5.0,"I bought this, and I didn't know it contained shark collagen because it's all in Korean. I didn't want to love it. It was too late to cancel by the time I found out, it was already in the mail, coming to me, and I was out of my toner, so I figured, okay I'll try this, and then I won't buy it again.

Goddamnit.

This stuff is amazing.

It makes my skin so soft, so smooth, it feels so nice... I can't help it, I LOVE this stuff. It replaced my&nbsp;Cosrx Aha/bha Clarifying Treatment Toner 150ml&nbsp;really quickly. I didn't want to love it because I don't want to contribute to animal cruelty!

I wanted to hate it, I wanted it to not work, or smell funny, or be a negligible difference, but it really worked wonders, and it feels noticeably different than my COSRX toner, and that toner isn't bad by any means, it's a GREAT toner! It's a wonderful toner, I had no complaints with that toner, I was just trying to find a more inexpensive toner, and I wanted to try something new. I had no idea this had SHARK collagen in it, I thought it was just... I don't know, whatever collagen is in other products. But after checking their website, I was very surprised. But this product is amazing, it leaves my skin so soft and so touchable, I can't believe it, I just want to touch my face. It came with samples of their other creams, and they are also amazing and leave my face so soft... the day and night cream I believe doesn't have any shark collagen in it, so I may buy that, I got a sample of that and it was really nice. I love this product, despite myself. It's really great. Give it about 30 minutes to fully absorb before applying other facial products, and then continue with your facial routine.

Beware, this is not a cruelty-free product, it can't be... how can there be cruelty-free shark cartilage? I keep asking myself that... I asked the seller but I got no response. I really wish it was because I LOVE this product. I can't help it, this stuff is amazing... but I can't buy it again, I can't hurt animals... it's just not right in my book. >.<",A28HBJOYP6BL62,5.0,5.0,4.0

"1oz Amber Glass Dropper Bottles (12 pack), Refillable Glass Bottles for Essential Oils, Cosmetics, Cooking, and More! (12 Pack)",4.0,"I have been using a lot of essential oils lately, mainly for diffusing. There are a few brands that I have come to trust, and after a few years, I finally feel safe in venturing to create some oil blends. This set of amber glass bottles will be the perfect receptacles for my new oil blends.

I really like that the bottles come with glass droppers as opposed to those stoppers that most essential oil bottles have in them. I have found that using those stoppers is really a crap shoot. Some work great, some don't let any oil out, and some may as not be there because the oil pours out of them. I plan to use the droppers from these bottles to get the oil out of my other bottles, so that I can ensure the right ratio of oil to oil.

The bottles don't leak when closed properly. I tested them by filling them with water and turning them upside down. The droppers work perfectly and I can control how many drops of which oils go into my new blends, and then I'll be able to keep track of the blends I like best and how much of what went into them. I'll feel like a potions student from Hogwarts, but that's fine with me. I'm really looking forward to coming up with some blends that are good enough to give as gifts.

I do wish that the bottles had come with labels. I have some labels that I use for the lids of my other oils, but since these have droppers and are 1-oz. bottles, they'll be able to accommodate larger labels. So now I need to go label hunting, and I'll be all set. I do appreciate that the bottles are thick amber glass, because that will protect my oils from outside light and keep them fresher longer. I feel that the bottles are a great value for a set of 12, and I would definitely recommend them.

I received the bottles free in return for my honest review. My reviews are done in compliance with Amazon's TOS and FTC regulations, and I never guarantee a favorable review. I have personally tested this product.",A2PF6BJMN72RC1,4.0,4.0,4.0
Body Tonique Repair &amp; Replenish Facial &amp; Body Oil,3.0,"I developed an eczema on my eye lids as a result of sun exposure.  My usual eye creams do not work for me anymore as they irritate my extremely sensitive skin and cause new flare-ups.  While I found a few eye products that do not sting or cause more irritation, I am constantly searching for more and kind of obsessed right now to get more relief from itching and redness.  So among other eye products I ordered Body Tonique Repair and Replenish Facial and Body Oil.  It arrived promptly in a sealed 4 ounce plastic bottle.  The twist on and off lid is convenient for precise dispensing.  The oil is a mixture of several carrier oils with mostly oils that are found in the kitchen.  It also has a blend of essential oils that is kept a secret by manufacturer.  I was able to recognize lemon and lavender oils in it.  I applied this oil under my eyes only where I have eczema.  It was absorbed some but left a very noticeable greasy residue.  It felt okay on the lower lids but the oil got on my eye lashes and into my eyes and caused some eye irritation and blurred vision.  It made me blink constantly.  I should put less oil and even lower next time to prevent this from happening.  I already used jojoba, argan, moringa seed, rose hip and sea buckthorn oils and found them to work better and not leave so much greasy residue on my lids.  It is probably better to use it on the body than on the face, and definitely away from the eyes.  However, the biggest issue I have with the price.  While I was offered a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I think the regular price is extremely high for what it is and I will not repurchase this product in the future.",A2Y771VL7HT81N,3.0,3.0,4.0

Cash &amp; Bash | NUTSACK &amp; HOOF | 3-IN-ONE | Face Wash + Shaving Serum + Moisturizer | Vanilla + Rice Bran Oil | Premium Skin Care with Anti-inflammatory and Antibacterial Properties,5.0,"A sample was sent to me for test and evaluation purposes.  This man-specific shaving serum is very different from the more familiar shaving foams and gels that my husband normally buys.  For a start, the airless pump container requires priming the pump, meaning you have to expel all the air out of the bottle before the contents start to come out in any quantity.  Once done, the fairly viscous clear gel is delivered in short burst.  Although tempted to pile it on thickly, my husband started with an amount similar to an almond and found it to be quite sufficient to address a week-old growth.

I felt the consistency of the serum applied to damp skin, and it reminded me more of a face cream than a shaving product, but I have to say, the razor was gliding very easily, leaving behind soft, smooth, bare skin.  Once the shaving was done, a little rinsing with clear water produced a milky white residue which was quickly absorbed.  The scent is delicious, a little sweet until body chemistry adapts it, but I detected vanilla and some of the lighter herbal elements.

The ingredients include some lovely botanical compounds like rice bran oil, sunflower oil, extracts of yarrow, peppermint, melissa and mallow, vitamin E and coumarin, a phytochemical responsible for the vanilla-like scent.  The blurb says it's a multi-purpose product that can also be used as a face wash and moisturizer, so it would be useful on a trip when luggage space is at a premium, but my husband is going to use it strictly for shaving, since there is also a very creamy moisturizer in the range.  If you find it a bit pricey, consider that the 50 g will last you a lot longer than comparable gels based on artificial soapy compounds.  This brand does not test on animals and is committed to natural ingredients as far as possible; I appreciate the honesty and the intent.",A234YLAS2MYYWA,5.0,5.0,4.0
Cash &amp; Bash | NUTSACK &amp; HOOF | 3-IN-ONE | Face Wash + Shaving Serum + Moisturizer | Vanilla + Rice Bran Oil | Premium Skin Care with Anti-inflammatory and Antibacterial Properties,5.0,"&nbsp;Cash and Bash do not test their products on animals, so they asked me to be one of the human testers for their shaving products: the serum and the cream. I take being a tester very seriously and only accept products for testing if the seller confirms that they want an honest review after a several weeks of testing, good or bad.  I have a history of leaving critical reviews on regular basis.

I have to confess that I have not been very selective about shaving cream for my under arms.  All the stuff I used in the past have been pretty much the same.  This Cash and Bash serum is really different.  The shaving serum feels like you are applying clear oily moisturizer. It does not foam it does not look like shaving cream.  It goes on clear.  It covers my skin with somewhat oily film and the razor just glided over it removing all the little hairs.  The skin is left very smooth still having some of the oily film that was not removed by the action of the razor. Washing with water removes the oily left overs leaving a very smooth skin. Nice!  I did not use much just a small amount for each under arm.  The scent is very subtle, slightly fruity.

After washing off the remnants of the serum I applied a small drop of cream. It also has a very subtle scent, more vanilla than mint.  It felt non-greasy and when I put on a shirt right after applying it did not stain the shirt.

The serum comes in a small pump bottle.  The bottle is 4.5"" tall (not counting the pump) and holds 4 oz.

SERUM INGREDIENTS:
Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol Dipelargonate, Aqua (Water), Sucrose Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Sucrose Stearate, Parfum, Tocopherol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alcohol, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Primula Veris Extract, Veronica Officinalis Extract, Benzyl Benzoate, Coumarin, Linalool, Benzyl Cinnamate

I think of shaving as an unpleasant task that must be done and I do it as infrequently I can get away with.  The Cash & Bash serum/cream combo made it much better. No razor burn.

OliaDesign 8pcs 3&quot; Boutique Hair Bows Girls Kids Children Alligator Clip Grosgrain Ribbon Headbands 8 Color (8 pcs),5.0,"**This review is for the OliaDesign 8pcs 3"" Boutique Hair Bows Girls Kids Children Alligator Clip Grosgrain Ribbon Headbands 8 Color (8 pcs)**

My daughter has really gotten into wearing different hair bows in her hair when she goes to school.  Sometimes my husband does her hair in the morning when i'm not there and lets face it, he isn't the best when it comes to that.  These hair bows are so cute and you get so different colors that have white polka dots on them.  They are easy to put in the hair, so easy that my husband has no issues with these.

You get 8 bows and each one is a different color with white polka dots.  They are a ribbon material and the colors are very vibrant and pretty.  They have the alligator clips on the bows, so you don't have to mess with clasps or anything(those other clasps are hard for my husband to deal with, he loves the alligator clips).

You can put the hair up in a ponytail, braid or up-do and just clip this in.  They don't fall out of the hair, and my daughter being a 6 year old that loves to play comes home with these still clipped in her hair.  I completely recommend it and think they are really cute in my daughter's hair.

SOONPURE Snail Serum 10ml,5.0,"This item arrived well-packaged in an Amazon box. It was was contained in a really cute shrink-wrapped box (see pic). The serum is in a small glass vial with a rubber stopper on top to prevent leaks and spills. Also included was a flexible rubberized dropper tip. The dropper tip fits securely on the opened vial and you simply turn it over and let the serum fall into the tip and gently squeeze out using your fingers to get precise drop applications (see pic). It's a very nice dispensing mechanism and one that I've never seen before.

I was interested in trying this product because of the purported benefits of snail mucus in skincare. Snail secretion filtrate is suppose to help with DNA repair and resiliency  and is said to be good for both acne prone skin and dry, aging skin. The consistency of the serum is quite gel-like. It's very thick but it feels most like glycerin. As mentioned, it's quite easy to dispense dropperfuls of product where you need them. I've been using it for a few days and while I haven't noticed dramatic differences, it does seem to hydrate and plump the area in which I place it (mostly fine lines and wrinkles). A quick look at the ingredient list shows there is snail secretion filtrate in it, but it's not near the top. I know you can get serums contain snail secretion filtrate where it's the first or second ingredient.

Ingredients
H2O, glycerol, butanediol, hydroxyethyl urea, glycerol polyglycerol acrylate/acrylic copolymer propylene glycol PVM/MA copolymer, snail secreta filtrate, hydroxypropyl guar gum, triethanolamine, carbomer, polyethylene glycol-10, C8H9ClN2O2S2

Oliadesign Pack of 6 The princess Texture Flash Diamond Emerald Elastic Hair Bands Headband Hair Jewelry,5.0,"The Oliadesign 6 pack of princess hair bands are very nice.  My soon to be middle school neice loves wearing headbands like this. She loved these and thought they looked more grown up than her brightly colored ones she normally wears.  These have lots of bling on them as she described them. They have stones all over them in different designs and colors. They fit her head comfortably.  She feels a little more dressed up with these on and loves them.

Oliadesign Pack of 6 The princess Texture Flash Diamond Emerald Elastic Hair Bands Headband Hair Jewelry,4.0,"These headbands are gorgeous, no denying it. I thought it was all metal, but they are wrapped in metallic threads, so it's not hard on the head. The crystal accents are darling, and I love the colors. These are small enough for my daughter's head, but large and stretchy enough for mine. The only complaint I have is that the wire holding the crystals on one of the bands broke. Not hard to fix, but still disappointing. Other than that, I love them. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.",A170PWRJE5FJ7Z,4.5,4.0,4.0
Oliadesign Pack of 10 Barrettes Bobby Pin Hair Clips Bride Headwear Edge Clip Clamps,5.0,"The OliaDesign 10 pack Barrettes are really lovely.  Some are attached to your hair with alligator clips and some are like bobby pins and spring. I love alligator clips they are so easy to get in your hair and they stay put. Most of the ones I got were alligator clips.  These all have a lot of bling on them.  Each one is a different design. I got a heart, several flower shapes, bow and bow tie.  They are all a copper in color with sparkles and a design on them.  One was covered in a red fabric changing the appearance drastically it was very elegant looking.

All the clips were in perfect working order.  They were no marks on them and all the bling was in place. This is a really nice set of hair barrettes.

"Oliadesign&reg; Set of 10 Boutique Girls Toddler Hair Bow Snap Alligator Clips, Barrettes",5.0,"**This review is for the Oliadesign Set of 10 Boutique Girls Toddler Hair Bow Snap Alligator Clips, Barrettes**

Every little girl loves to have their hair look pretty and most of them love to wear hair bows.  My daughter has really gotten into wearing different hair bows in her hair when she goes to school.  Sometimes my husband does her hair in the morning when i'm not there and lets face it, he isn't the best when it comes to that.  These flower hair clips are so cute and you get so many different colors and they are easy to put in the hair, so easy that my husband has no issues with these.

You get 10 flower hair clips and each one is a different color.  The colors are very vibrant and pretty.  They have the alligator clips on the bows, so you don't have to mess with clasps or anything(those other clasps are hard for my husband to deal with, she loves the alligator clips).

You can put the hair up in a ponytail, braid or up-do and just clip this in.  They don't fall out of the hair, and my daughter being a 6 year old that loves to play comes home with these still clipped in her hair.  I completely recommend it and think they are really cute in my daughter's hair.

"Oliadesign&reg; Set of 10 Boutique Girls Toddler Hair Bow Snap Alligator Clips, Barrettes",4.0,"Very colorful range of flowers, and they're very pretty. My only contention is that they're attached to the clip by some white cardboard looking pieces. This makes the flower stand up, and though the white design makes it a little less obtrusive, it still isn't a very pretty way to display the flower. You almost have to wear several flowers to hide that. Otherwise, I like them. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.",A170PWRJE5FJ7Z,4.666666666666667,4.0,4.0

SOONPURE Concentrated Hyaluronic Acid Eyes Serum 10 ml,4.0,"I am suffering from an eye eczema as a result of prolonged sun exposure. My eyes are itchy and have dark reddish circles underneath, which prompt questions from those who have not seen me for awhile, what happened to my eyes. There have been some assumptions that I have been beaten and do not want to admit that. Needless to say, I am quite eager to lose the look that I am sporting right now, and am obsessed with eye serums and eye creams that can help me with that. So, among others I tried SoonPure Concentrated Hyaluronic Acid Eye Serum.

It arrived promptly and was properly sealed. The box features abundant hieroglyphs writings which I hoped were in Korean, as I highly respect Korean beauty products, but most likely they are in Chinese. I tried to find that out by visiting the website that is listed on the box, however, I found it to be nonexistent. Some lines are poorly translated to English: ""Supplementary eye water and nutrients "", ""Improve the black eye to improve the eye fine lines"", ""Improve eye week"". There is no translation of the ingredient list, however, PEG-40 is in English, and it is my understanding that it is not a desired ingredient for the skin care products. There are some Latin names: Avena sativa, Tremella foci forms, and Butyrospermum parkii, the latter I believe is Shea butter.

The serum comes in a clear 10 ml bottle. An eye dropper was enclosed in the package and needs to be inserted in the bottle. The liquid itself is clear and colorless. It is very runny, but slightly more viscous than water. I was happy that it did not irritate the skin under my eyes which is extremely sensitive right now. I feel that a separate moisturizer is needed to be applied on top to keep the eye area from drying. The serum did not leave a sticky or greasy residue which is a plus. I just started using it a few days ago, so I cannot report any reduction in eye circles. I will update later, if with continued use I see a noticeable difference. I do not currently have any puffiness under my eyes. The serum did not clogged the pores or caused any breakouts. With addition of moisturizer it will probably help with the reduction of fine lines, or at least prevent the formation of the new ones. I received this serum at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",A2Y771VL7HT81N,4.0,4.0,4.0
SOONPURE Red Ginseng Snail Face Cream 60g,4.0,"This product arrived packed well in an Amazon box. The jar itself was in its own shrink-wrapped box. Unfortunately, when I opened it, the lid was cracked, probably during manufacture (see pic). There was a protective insert on top of the jar, so no product was lost. I was able to superglue the piece back in place, so no harm, no foul.

I purchased this mainly because I was interested in the effects of Red Ginseng and snail mucus in skincare. Red Ginseng is suppose to be the most potent and effective form of ginseng. It has been shown to ease dryness, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and treat discoloration in the skin. Snail mucus also seems to be having a moment. Snail secretion filtrate in skincare is suppose to help with anti-aging by stimulating the formation of collagen and elastin, repair damaged skin, and restore hydration. However, even though this cream is called ""Red Ginseng Snail Face Cream"", a close look at the listed ingredients shows no snail secretion filtrate.

Ingredients
Water, propylene glycol, mineral oil, cetearyl alcohol, glycerol ester of stearyl alcohol (and) PEG-100 stearate, cetearyl glucoside and cetearyl alcohol, dimethicone (and) polydimethylsiloxane alcohol, butyrospermum park II fruit butter, cyclic polydimethylsiloxane, glycerin, allantoin, sodium hyaluronate, xanthan gum, polyacrylamide (and) C13-C14 isoparaffins alkanes (and) laureth -7, butylene glycol and water and PANAX GINSENG root extract, methyl ethyl thiazolinone, C114140, and 0177266 flavor.

Even so, it does have some good things like hyaluronic acid, allantoin and shea butter. I used the cream for a few nights and it is quite nice. The consistency is more of a gel-cream similar to Laneige water bank cream or Neutrogena Hydroboost. It spreads easily and absorbs after a few minutes. Its not greasy at all, but skin feels hydrated. I think it would be best for oily/combination skin or if you have dry skin and don't want a heavy feeling on your face, particularly during the summer. The color is a very light pink and it does smell very lightly of ginseng. I'm happy I tried it and will probably use it throughout the hotter months.",A3S5FRDKD52VBG,4.0,4.0,4.0

It seemed to absorb fully into my skin. My skin feels soft and moisturized. With the exception of the perfume, I really liked this one.

But I like these a lot for a couple reasons. They stay on pretty well and each sticker has a mirror image. It drives me a little crazy when the opposing hands have an identical pattern on it. They are very long but I just stuck them on my nails and then filed off the excess. The only reason I took off one star is because on several nails, the stickers are lifting up on the corners and then get caught in my hair. I did use top coat over them so there's that.

It is a little bit dificult to apply and make sure that they are staying put, so, you have to secure them with extra coats of clear nail polish.

That's the best way I can describe it.  It goes on nice and light tho, it's not as dark as it appears in the tube.  It's a great natural color.  The applicator is great.  The formula feels very hydrating.  Slightly on the thicker side, which I love because I'm a chapstick junkie so I feel like my lips are very hydrated with this formula.

Set of 10: HBY8482; 5&quot; Soft Cotton Workout &amp; Yoga Stretch Moisture Wicking Headband Small Size,4.0,"Wow, now I have enough headbands to last me for the rest of my life.  The 10-pack is useful to me because I'm breakout prone, and can't afford to take the risk of wearing the same headband again.  This gives me enough headbands so that I use a fresh headband every day and still make it to ""laundry day.""

These headbands are better than the other HBY headbands I tried that were made out of shiny spandex.  (Which were slippery, poorly stitched, and definitely not moisture-wicking at all.)  These appear to be some type of cotton blend jersey, which is very comfortable and grips my smooth hair better, and there are no problems with the seams.  The product description says 5 inches, but they're really more like 4.75 inches, but that works in my favor, since the wider ones slide off my head too easily.

Also, unlike the other headbands I tried, this time I got exactly the colors that were pictured in the product photos.  These headbands are much better performers overall than the spandex ones, and I'm happy with the quality.  I still can't use these for running or sleeping, since they slide off my smooth hair at the drop of a hat, but they are very useful for face-washing and general lounging.  I've attached a photo showing the smooth jersey knit, for reference.

Living Nature Rich Nourishing Mature Skin Cream,5.0,"In the space of a couple years, I moved from the Nevada desert to the tropics of Hawaii, to the tundra of Alaska.  This has wrecked havoc on my skin.  I went from dry to oily to combination skin.  I've gone to the dermatologist, who put me on a regimen that has now made my skin the driest it's ever been.  I don't appreciate my skin peeling every afternoon, and I'm also tired of putting harsh chemicals on my skin.  I recently made to switch to all-natural makeup, and I've been looking for a brand to switch to all natural skin care.  Hence, I was excited when I got to try out the Living Nature line at a discount.

The first thing that attracted me to this product is the fact that it's made in New Zealand.  I had the pleasure of visiting N Zed a couple years ago, and it was refreshing to see the high standards that the country has on organics the lack of pesticides, hormones and additives seen in meat, and how much fresher and better everything there smelled and tasted.  Having been there, I automatically trust the products produced there more than I would anywhere else.

As far as this anti-aging emollient face cream goes, I've been using it everyday, in conjunction with the rest of the line of Living Nature products, and I am very happy with the results.  The cream goes on smoothly, absorbs completely, is not too thick or too thin, it does not make me break out, and leaves me skin feeling soft.  Also, my skin is no longer peeling every afternoon, and not only is it a lot clearer/more even in tone, but it's also a lot firmer and youthful looking.  I can now see that the chemical products I was using were making my skin worse, not better.

I also have to mention that I really love the natural smell that the products in this line have.  It reminds of hiking through Karangahake Gorge and all the plant life you could smell whilst walking next to the raging river: damp, tropical, fresh, exotic.

It looks like I've found the brand to finally make the switch to all natural face products.  Highly recommend!",A1ZJXLH99D3ED8,4.5,5.0,4.0
Living Nature Rich Nourishing Mature Skin Cream,4.0,"If you have very dry or very mature skin then this is the day cream for you!  As much as I liked this Rich Day Cream by Living Nature it was just a little to intense for my oily/combination skin.  It was still something I enjoyed using but I had to stick to using it on my neck and decollete during the day or just use it as a night cream.
It is a very hydrating and nourishing cream that leaves skin soft and supple and moisturized all day long.  As with a lot of the other Living Nature products this one has all natural Active Manuka Honey Totara Extract which help promote moisture, nourishment and fight off skin-ageing free radicals!
However, if you have oily or combination skin this might not work as a day cream but I would highly recommend it for dry skin.

Living Nature Sensitive Skin Firming Eye Cream,5.0,"In the space of a couple years, I moved from the Nevada desert to the tropics of Hawaii, to the tundra of Alaska. This has wrecked havoc on my skin. I went from dry to oily to combination skin. Ive gone to the dermatologist, who put me on a regimen that has now made my skin the driest its ever been. I don't appreciate my skin peeling every afternoon, and Im also tired of putting harsh chemicals on my skin. I recently made to switch to all-natural makeup, and Ive been looking for a brand to switch to all natural skin care. Hence, I was excited when I got to try out the Living Nature line at a discount.
The first thing that attracted me to this product is the fact that its made in New Zealand. I had the pleasure of visiting N Zed a couple years ago, and it was refreshing to see the high standards that the country has on organics the lack of pesticides, hormones and additives seen in meat, and how much fresher and better everything there smelled and tasted. Having been there, I automatically trust the products produced there more than I would anywhere else.

I have been slowly noticing some fine lines creeping in below my eyes, and its been bothering me. Ive tried a lot of other skin serums that have not amounted to any sort of difference. If anything, I think my skin has been having some bad reactions to the chemicals in them. After trying this firming eye cream along with Living Nature's Skin Firming Serum for a week, Ive noticed that I look more rested. The lines under my eyes are less noticeable, and I feel like the hollows beneath my eyes are also less pronounced. I guess I just look healthier overall. Its obvious that my skin really did not like the chemical products that I previously used, as its really liking these all natural products!

I also have to mention that I really love the natural smell that the products in this line have. It reminds of hiking through Karangahake Gorge and all the plant life you could smell whilst walking next to the raging river: damp, tropical, fresh, exotic.

It looks like Ive found the brand to finally make the switch to all natural face products. Highly recommend!",A1ZJXLH99D3ED8,5.0,5.0,4.0
Living Nature Sensitive Skin Firming Eye Cream,5.0,"Sometimes finding a good, all natural Eye Cream that does everything you want it to do can be a bit difficult.  For me, the two most important requirements are that I want my eye cream to hydrate and smooth out my fine lines.  This Firming Eye Cream by Living Nature does exactly that!
This Firming Eye Cream by Living Nature uses the nourishing benefits of Manuka Honey and the soothing and plumping qualities of Harakeke Flax Gel to really help make this a potent Eye Cream!
I tend to use different Eye Creams in the morning than I do at night and this Firming Eye Cream is the perfect morning Eye Cream for me.  It's nourishes and moisturizes my under eye area but it's lightweight enough so it's quickly absorbed making it the perfect Eye Cream to wear under make up.  It also helps smooth out those annoying fine lines and that makes this all natural and organic Eye Cream a definite winner!  Being fragrance free also makes this Eye Cream a great choice for those with sensitive skin!

Having been there, I automatically trust the products produced there more than I would anywhere else.

I have tried so many different brands and types of lotions and natural alternatives, I couldn't begin to count them all.  For awhile I was using pure sweet almond oil as a moisturizer, but it's really oily/greasy.  Using natural oils is a nice thought, but not realistic.  It gets all over your clothes and anything you touch, and makes you look shiny.  Not good.  Living Nature's natural body lotion felt great upon application, absorbing completely, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth.  Previously, my skin would itch by the end of the day and look ashy, but this Natural Body Lotion has resolved those skin problems. I have been using this after washing with Living Nature's Gentle Foaming Cleanser, and love using the two together.

I also have to mention that I really love the natural smell that the products in this line have. It reminds of hiking through Karangahake Gorge and all the plant life you could smell whilst walking next to the raging river: damp, tropical, fresh, exotic.

Living Nature Natural Body Lotion for Dry Skin,5.0,"This quickly became a new favorite body lotion!  As soon as I put it on my skin it left my skin feeling silky smooth and I knew we had a winner.  Not only is it an all natural and organic body lotion but it smells light and fresh and it's extremely hydrating.
My favorite way to use this is to combine with the Living Nature Body Wash.  I apply the Refreshing Body Lotion right after I get out of the shower while my skin is still slightly damp and the lotion is almost immediately absorbed leaving skin nourished.  The Shea Butter in it really does soften and soothe the skin and it's very long lasting.  I can put it on in the evening and it will last well into the next day. Also, because it's a light neutral scent it can be used by everyone in the family.
If you pair this Refreshing Body Lotion by Living Nature with their Nourishing Body Wash you have a match made in Heaven!

SOONPURE Hyaluronic Acid Cleanser 100g,4.0,"Yes, the box is printed in Chinese.  I don't know why people are bewildered.  Everyone knows how to use face wash, right?  Directions aren't really necessary for something like this....

Here's what I'd want to know:

Does it clean well?  Yes.  I have oily skin, and this took the remains of the days off without leaving my skin tight.

Does it smell good?  Not really, but it doesn't smell bad either.  It's clean---but it doesn't appeal to me personally.

Is it a pleasure to use?  Yes.  It's a cream texture--and pea sized blob produces a lot of lather.  It seems to rinse well.  I don't look forward to using it because I don't love the smell, but it takes makeup off quickly.

Does it outperform drugstore level cleansers?  No.  I've used many face washes like this in the past.  It reminds me of the Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Cream Cleanser ($7.99 for 5oz) which I didn't love.  This cleanser is pleasant enough.....but it's not anything I would rush out to buy again.

"ONLY 1 IN PACK Maybelline The Colossal Spider Effect Waterproof Mascara, 222 Classic Black",5.0,"LOVE this mascara! I have very sensitive eyes and skin, so finding a good mascara can be a chore. Spider Effects didn't irritate my eyes at all - no itching or burning. It stayed in place and didn't flake off, either.  My eyelashes tend to clump anyway, and this mascara makes them look good instead of a gluey, pasted mess.  Instead your lashes look long, sleek and turn your eyes so big and bright.

"Am&eacute;lie Moisturizer With Retinol, Vitamin E &amp; Hyaluronic Acid. Night Cream For Wrinkles, Lines &amp; Other Signs of Aging. Anti-aging Formula With Organic and Natural Ingredients.",5.0,"Retinol is really a wonder skincare ingredient - it helps with wrinkles, acne, dark spots, eczema, and shrinking pores. My skin can be pretty dry and sensitive, so I was worried to test out this product. I have heard that retinol can sometimes be intense for some people's skin. But I am so glad that I tried this retinol moisturizer from Amelie Skincare!

The packing of this retinol moisturizer is clean and simple. I have been using this moisturizer for some time now. I worried that the retinol would cause my skin to dry out, but it did the opposite! This cream makes my face feel so hydrated and nourished. I've been applying this product at night after my toner and serum. I have sensitive skin, and this product did not cause any negative reactions. It makes my skin feel much tighter and firmer than it ever has before.

I have noticed that some of my wrinkles and laugh lines are diminishing! This cream has also helped to get rid of some cheek acne that I've been getting recently. My skin does feel firmer after using this product. Overall, this is a wonderful cream that has so many skincare benefits! Other ingredients in this product include shea butter, vitamin E, and jojoba oil. These are known for helping with aging and complexion issues. This product is high quality and natural.

Amalia Antioxidant Milk,5.0,"I was so excited to try out this cream! I was looking for the perfect moisturizer than I can use every morning before I apply makeup.

I have been using this cream every morning before I apply my daily makeup. This cream did not have any negative effects on my makeup application. I actually feel like this cream helped my makeup adhere to my skin and last longer than it has in the past! This cream is very easy to apply and absorbs quickly into my skin. The cream itself does feel very luxurious. It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy, which is super important to me. I have been using this smoothing treatment cream on both my face and neck. It's important to take care of your neck as you do your face. This Amelie Skincare facial moisturizer also has a light and pleasant scent. It's definitely been a treat to use this on my skin!

After using this cream for about a week, I have noticed results. My skin looks smoother already and my fine lines are diminishing. My skin also always feels hydrated and moisturized for the whole day, when I only apply it in the morning! I feel like this is the one cream I need in my morning routine. It really is effective!

[SNP] Aqua Energy Fermentation Mask (10EA),4.0,"I try to use a sheet mask at least 5 times a week.  I subscribe to a couple of sheet mask subscription boxes and I received this mask in one of them and tried it out yesterday.

As a mask, it was pleasant.  It was easy to unfold without ripping, it fit my face fairly well, it didn't drip on my shirt too much, and it stayed in place once positioned.  It was a little high on the serum so it took a minute after removing for it all to soak in, but it wasn't too much of an inconvenience (at least, not much more than any other mask I've tried lately).  Afterwards, I continued my morning skincare routine and then applied makeup and this did not interfere with any subsequent products I used.

This has a light fragrance that is slightly fruity.  It honestly doesn't persist for long after you apply the mask.  It does not have any artificial dyes and it did not irritate my skin or eyes while I was wearing it.

I cannot find a complete ingredients list in English but of course I have found a few highlights.  This has extracts of blueberry, grape, chia seeds, mung bean, and soybean.  These are fermented to form something called a ""blue energy complex.""  I am skeptical of whether fermentation would actually do much to alter the ingredients in an effective way (search for ""Fermented Skin Care, the Latest Korean Beauty Trend, Might Not Do Anything"" and read the Racked article for a more complete explanation, which makes sense to me as a biochemistry PhD).

That being said, I do like the ingredients.  Blueberry and grape are excellent sources of antioxidants and vitamins so this could be good to use after a long day of sun exposure (of course you should also be using a good SPF product).  Chia seeds have lots of proteins and fatty acids and I have always found fatty acid-containing products to be quite moisturizing.  Mung bean extract is supposed to help tone and reduce pore size.  I can't say whether I actually noticed a change or not, there.  Soy extract is supposed to be soothing and I do think this mask is soothing (Paula's Choice rates soy extract as ""best"" in their ingredients database).

Anyway, I found the mask moisturizing and smoothing and I do think I saw a little redness reduction.  Plus, even if I can't see antioxidants and vitamins working on a microscopic level, I like knowing that they're in my skincare.

For reference, this listing is for ten masks listed at around twenty bucks total, so it is competitive at this time.",A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,4.0,4.0,4.0
