I asked three friends separately, what they think of it, and each one said, that this smells manly. And that was the exact word I was looking for. First two girls did not want to take this from me for free, the third one took it, but stated that really just a little at a time can be used.

Norelco has always said \"shaves as close as a blade or your money back\".  I\\'ve never found this to be true, but the razors were good enough that I didn\\'t return them.  Most recently I used the Gilette Mach 3 razor which does a very good job.\\nNow here\\'s why I give the 6885XL (6886XL is apparently the same model, sold at Costco and other warehouse stores) 5 stars:\\n- Closest shave yet.  This is the first electric razor I\\'ve used that shaves as close as a blade (including the Mach 3).  In fact, it shaves closer than a blade under my jaw and around my adam\\'s apple.  I can\\'t shave against the grain with a blade in those areas or my skin breaks out (and that\\'s the only way to get the closest shave.)  With the 6885XL I don\\'t have this problem and I get a really close shave.\\n- It\\'s quiet.  Previous electric razors were so noisy I had to shave in another bathroom so I wouldn\\'t wake my wife.  Not so with this one.\\n- Easy to clean.  Open the top and run hot water through it.  No more brushes (except for periodic maintenance).  An indicator will tell you when it\\'s time to clean.\\nOther features:\\n- Charge remaining (in minutes) display.  This isn\\'t particularly useful to me, but it seems reasonable accurate.\\n- It comes with a stand that holds the razor upright on the counter or basin.  Much neater than the razor just laying around or stuffed in a cabinet.\\n- Hard carrying case, for travel.\\n- Automatically adjusts to different voltages.\\nMy wife about had a heart attack when I bought it.  However, it gives me the best shave ever (electric or blades).']: 4.0\n",

No one ever told me that until I learned a few years ago. As you get older; your tongue forms little pockets on the top of your tongue. Dairy (milk, cheese, ice cream, etc) get in those holes of your tongue that causes bad breath too, so much sure you brush as close as you can back there.

      " 'I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth. However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions as specified inside the box.\\n\\n1. Use the strips as directed on the box.  The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide; (in-office, or dentist-assisted dental whitening uses a 15-35% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white. Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.\\n\\n2. Leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth, as this leads to sensitivity.\\n\\nDisadvantages\\n\\n1. Hydrogen Peroxide can \"burn\" your gums. If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn). Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to want to stop the treatment. It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal. Once they are healed, resume treatment with the White Strips. Try to not get the strip on your gums.\\n\\n2. Your teeth may become senstiive during the week treatment time. Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off. You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc.  The peroxide causes a reversible inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.  If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching.\\n\\n3. The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach. You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth. Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal. However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.\\n\\n4. The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains. If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to begin bleaching with yoru dentist and then use the strips to continue the bleaching process.\\n\\nNow comes the confusing part: Crest White Strips come in 4 different packages, each a bit different than the others.  The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  Here are the 4 packages:  1. Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  2. Crest White Strips Premium (10% hydrogen peroxide, 7-day treatment).  3. Crest White Strips Premium Plus (10% hydrogen peroxide, and has 12 additional strips).  4. Crest White Strips Renewal (9.5% hydrogen peroxide).  The cheapest method (at around 25 dollars, is the Crest Classic Whitestrips, but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment).  Premium and Premium Pro are both 10% peroxide formulations, work in 7-10 days, and the \"Premuim-Plus\" gives you 12 additional strips.  I am not sure why Crest recently came out with \"Renewal\", as it is a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10% concentration. Leave it to the manufacturer to confuse the consumer!\\n\\nCrest White Strips work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.\\n\\nIf you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching.  This is much more expensive, but the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is much higher and this works better on stubbornly-stained teeth.\\n\\nJim \"Konedog\" Koenig, DDS']: 4.0\n",

      " 'I am a dentist who recommends Crest White Strips because they do work to whiten teeth.  Follow the directions in the box, and here are some further tips:\\n\\n1.  (Optional step)  I recommend you first brush your teeth with water (don\\'t use toothpaste) to remove the layer of plaque.  Your enamel has pores and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate. If you use a fluoridated toothpaste, the flouride may block the enamel pores.  (Crest\\'s instructions indicate you do not need to brush. I talked to a Crest representative on this point, and she indicated that the hydrogen peroxide will penetrate plaque, therefore this step is optional.  The instructions indicate no brushing because they do not want fluoridated toothpaste on the teeth before whitening).\\n\\n2.  Use the strips twice per day for maximum efectiveness.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called carbamide peroxide (a 6% form of hydrogen peroxide; in-office dental whitening uses a 15-30% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white.  Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.\\n\\n2.  Leave the strips on for 30 minutes at a time.  After thirty minutes your saliva has probably diluted the peroxide to the extent that it is no longer effective.  You can reapply a new strip immediately if you chose, for the treatment requires one hour of treatment time per day to work.  It does not matter if you do this in one continuous 60-minute period or two 30-minute periods.  Do this for two weeks and your teeth should get whiter.\\n\\nDisadvantages\\n\\n1.  The chemical may \"burn\" your gums.  If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the peroxide oxidizing (or burning) your gums.  Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to stop the treatment.  It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal.  Once they feel normal again, resume treatment with the White Strips.\\n\\n2.  Your teeth may become senstiive during the two-week treatment time.  Try to push yourself through the sensitivity if it is mild, but if it bothersome to cold water or air, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off.\\n\\n3.  The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach.  You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth.  Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a concern.  However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.\\n\\n3.

Over time, you will get a result that should be whiter than when you started.  Crest White Strips are a good place to start with bleaching, and if you are not satisfied with the results, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching or other cosmetic options.\\n\\nkonedog DDS']: 4.0\n",

Every 3-7 years I buy a new Norelco and they get incrementally better each time.\\n\\nI\\'m writing to warn about one feature.  Every shaver I\\'d had up to this one had a physical slider switch to turn it on and off.  This models has a push button.  This means you can\\'t tell BY TOUCH whether it\\'s on or off.  This is critical for me because I usually shave in the car (sitting in traffic) with the stereo blaring and I can\\'t hear the shaver (especially since the newer models are pretty quiet).
