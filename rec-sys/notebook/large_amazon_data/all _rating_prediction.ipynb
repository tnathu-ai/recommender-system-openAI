      "Unexpected response for the provided details: Based on the details provided, several factors might influence the product's rating. These factors include the brand reputation of Jenna Jameson, the price of the perfume being relatively low at $13.85, the description of the fragrance being described as young, sexy, and seductive, and the inclusion of popular ingredients such as raspberry, rose petals, jasmine, and sandalwood. Additionally, the fact that the product is discontinued by the manufacturer might also impact its rating, as customers may have concerns about availability and future support. Overall, based on these details, the product's rating could potentially be influenced positively by its affordable price and appealing fragrance description, but negatively by its discontinued status. Therefore, it is difficult to determine an exact rating without considering additional factors such as customer reviews and feedback.\n",
