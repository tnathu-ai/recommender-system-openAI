5.0,A141OPVE376YFI,B000050B65,"First, a little background.  I've switched between Norelco electric razors and blades over the years, never quite satisfied with the shave I was getting.  Norelco has always said ""shaves as close as a blade or your money back"".  I've never found this to be true, but the razors were good enough that I didn't return them.  Most recently I used the Gilette Mach 3 razor which does a very good job.
Now here's why I give the 6885XL (6886XL is apparently the same model, sold at Costco and other warehouse stores) 5 stars:
- Closest shave yet.  This is the first electric razor I've used that shaves as close as a blade (including the Mach 3).  In fact, it shaves closer than a blade under my jaw and around my adam's apple.  I can't shave against the grain with a blade in those areas or my skin breaks out (and that's the only way to get the closest shave.)  With the 6885XL I don't have this problem and I get a really close shave.
- It's quiet.  Previous electric razors were so noisy I had to shave in another bathroom so I wouldn't wake my wife.  Not so with this one.
- Easy to clean.  Open the top and run hot water through it.  No more brushes (except for periodic maintenance).  An indicator will tell you when it's time to clean.
Other features:
- Charge remaining (in minutes) display.  This isn't particularly useful to me, but it seems reasonable accurate.
- It comes with a stand that holds the razor upright on the counter or basin.  Much neater than the razor just laying around or stuffed in a cabinet.
- Hard carrying case, for travel.
- Automatically adjusts to different voltages.
My wife about had a heart attack when I bought it.  However, it gives me the best shave ever (electric or blades).","Finally, a razor that lives up to the ads",Norelco 6885XL Deluxe Quadra Action Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Men's Shaver

5.0,A141OPVE376YFI,B000050FDY,"I have the Braun 8585 razor; see my review there for my thoughts on that.

I do love the cleaning fluid despite what I think about the razor.  It works great - I've opened the razor after a cleaning cycle and the inside is spotless.  The smell is pleasant too.

Best of all, it lasts.  One cartridge lasts me 3 months.  I only clean my razor when the ""normal"" light is on, or every 2-3 shaves.  The cost to clean my razor works out to less than $20/year.  That's a bargain to me.  No more brushes or hot running water!  Now if only the razor did a better job...","Love the cleaning fluid, don't care much for the razor",Braun Clean &amp; Renew Refill Cartridges CCR - 2 Count (Packaging May Vary)

2.0,A6FIAB28IS79,B000050FDT,"The manufacturers of electric shavers appear to be taking pages out of the playbook used by makers of printers, which are often priced cheaper than the print cartridges themselves.  Once they've got you as a customer, they figure the red ink will soon be the customer's, not theirs.  Purchasing another screen (my 3rd or 4th in two years) for a shaver that cost me only 20% more than the flimsy foil itself strikes me as exhorbitant if not exploitive.  (The least Braun could do is make the foil available as a separate item rather than bundling it with the cutter assembly.)

5.0,A2UEO5XR3598GI,B0000530HU,"HEY!! I am an Aqua Velva Man and absolutely love this stuff, been using it for over 50 years. This is a true after shave lotion classic. Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.

There slogan was "" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.

Note :::; Some reviewers mention this 7oz size now comes in a plastic container, I just bought one in Wal-Mart and it was glass.",Truth is There IS Nothing Like an AQUA VELVA MAN.,"Aqua Velva After Shave, Classic Ice Blue, 7 Ounce"

5.0,A19FRW264WZTGP,B00005JS5C,"My wife and I were looking for a workable solution for the hair down under.  While her hair is not thick, it grows long very quickly.  She has tried waxing - too painful - and shaving would cause a lot of bumps and irritation, even with the Shick Intutition.

The trimmer is great.  Yes, Amazon should take down the photo of the storage pouch.  Yes, it won't get you totally smooth or bald.  Get a wax or laser removal if you want a total smooth finish. But it is a well built TRIMMER, which is painless and easy to use.  You can adjust the length you want, and you can easily work around the more sensitive and intimate southern locations.

Just take it easy around your bits.  It's helpful to use a mirror, assuming you're using it alone.  It's more fun if you have your partner help.  If you want the smooth look, use this handy device before you break out the razor and shaving cream/lotion. It makes it much easier and cuts down on irritation.

5.0,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B000067E30,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth. However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions as specified inside the box.

1. Use the strips as directed on the box.  The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide; (in-office, or dentist-assisted dental whitening uses a 15-35% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white. Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2. Leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth, as this leads to sensitivity.

Disadvantages

1. Hydrogen Peroxide can ""burn"" your gums. If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn). Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to want to stop the treatment. It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal. Once they are healed, resume treatment with the White Strips. Try to not get the strip on your gums.

2. Your teeth may become senstiive during the week treatment time. Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off. You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc.  The peroxide causes a reversible inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.  If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching.

3. The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach. You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth. Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal. However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.

4. The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains. If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to begin bleaching with yoru dentist and then use the strips to continue the bleaching process.

Now comes the confusing part: Crest White Strips come in 4 different packages, each a bit different than the others.  The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  Here are the 4 packages:  1. Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  2. Crest White Strips Premium (10% hydrogen peroxide, 7-day treatment).  3. Crest White Strips Premium Plus (10% hydrogen peroxide, and has 12 additional strips).  4. Crest White Strips Renewal (9.5% hydrogen peroxide).  The cheapest method (at around 25 dollars, is the Crest Classic Whitestrips, but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment).  Premium and Premium Pro are both 10% peroxide formulations, work in 7-10 days, and the ""Premuim-Plus"" gives you 12 additional strips.  I am not sure why Crest recently came out with ""Renewal"", as it is a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10% concentration. Leave it to the manufacturer to confuse the consumer!

Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching.  This is much more expensive, but the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is much higher and this works better on stubbornly-stained teeth.

After I have noticed this in the new picture, I love smiling for pictures now and showing my teeth. I was alway self conscious about it before.  That alone makes it worth the price.

I was very satisfied with my results. Make sure to read all the instructions before using.

4.0,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B000067E30,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest White Strips because they do work to whiten teeth.  Follow the directions in the box, and here are some further tips:

1.  (Optional step)  I recommend you first brush your teeth with water (don't use toothpaste) to remove the layer of plaque.  Your enamel has pores and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate. If you use a fluoridated toothpaste, the flouride may block the enamel pores.  (Crest's instructions indicate you do not need to brush. I talked to a Crest representative on this point, and she indicated that the hydrogen peroxide will penetrate plaque, therefore this step is optional.  The instructions indicate no brushing because they do not want fluoridated toothpaste on the teeth before whitening).

2.  Use the strips twice per day for maximum efectiveness.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called carbamide peroxide (a 6% form of hydrogen peroxide; in-office dental whitening uses a 15-30% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white.  Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2.  Leave the strips on for 30 minutes at a time.  After thirty minutes your saliva has probably diluted the peroxide to the extent that it is no longer effective.  You can reapply a new strip immediately if you chose, for the treatment requires one hour of treatment time per day to work.  It does not matter if you do this in one continuous 60-minute period or two 30-minute periods.  Do this for two weeks and your teeth should get whiter.

Disadvantages

1.  The chemical may ""burn"" your gums.  If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the peroxide oxidizing (or burning) your gums.  Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to stop the treatment.  It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal.  Once they feel normal again, resume treatment with the White Strips.

2.  Your teeth may become senstiive during the two-week treatment time.  Try to push yourself through the sensitivity if it is mild, but if it bothersome to cold water or air, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off.

3.  The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach.  You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth.

The shaving peformance is fine for me -- not as close as a wet shave but that's a good thing for me personally because the closeness of wet shaves makes my face break out.  Every 3-7 years I buy a new Norelco and they get incrementally better each time.

I'm writing to warn about one feature.  Every shaver I'd had up to this one had a physical slider switch to turn it on and off.  This models has a push button.  This means you can't tell BY TOUCH whether it's on or off.  This is critical for me because I usually shave in the car (sitting in traffic) with the stereo blaring and I can't hear the shaver (especially since the newer models are pretty quiet).  I turn it on and off a lot as traffic conditions change.

Further, when the battery is low, my previous shavers would just run slower and slower until they came to a gradual stop.  This one slows slightly (imperceptably to me, really) and then just ""falls off the cliff"" and stops cold.  So you don't get any warning really that it's about to run out -- if I knew it was running down, then I'd shave a lot faster!

And this is where the tactile power switch feedback is important:  if the battery's totally drained, but I'm not done yet, I'll leave it off for a minute and then turn it on for 5-10 seconds of shaving before it dies again.  With the push-button power control this is really confusing because you're never really sure what's on and off.  It turns out the the power button is like a pulse that gets sent to an internal microcontroller (I'm guessing), so after it's been off for a while the power ""position"" doesn't matter, it's really off.  You just push to reboot the thing.

This is critical for me because I usually shave in the car (sitting in traffic) with the stereo blaring and I can't hear the shaver (especially since the newer models are pretty quiet).  I turn it on and off a lot as traffic conditions change.

Further, when the battery is low, my previous shavers would just run slower and slower until they came to a gradual stop.  This one slows slightly (imperceptably to me, really) and then just ""falls off the cliff"" and stops cold.  So you don't get any warning really that it's about to run out -- if I knew it was running down, then I'd shave a lot faster!

And this is where the tactile power switch feedback is important:  if the battery's totally drained, but I'm not done yet, I'll leave it off for a minute and then turn it on for 5-10 seconds of shaving before it dies again.  With the push-button power control this is really confusing because you're never really sure what's on and off.  It turns out the the power button is like a pulse that gets sent to an internal microcontroller (I'm guessing), so after it's been off for a while the power ""position"" doesn't matter, it's really off.  You just push to reboot the thing.

So, my 7825XL was robbed out of my car last night and I'm buying another one of these, so I guess that's an endorsement.  But I'm bumping up to the next higher model with better battery status indication ...",good shave; don't like the power switch,Norelco 7825XL Quadra Action Dry Razor

People often ask what I'm wearing and where they can get it.  The original Creme Perfume in a tube (from the 1980's & 1990's) is no longer available and neither is the Body Lotion.  I do wish Ungaro would bring those items back.

I've used this brush nearly every day for at least 5 years now and the only reason I can tell its not brand-new is because the words ""Elizabeth Arden"" have worn off. I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation.

5.0,A31N0XY2UTB25C,B00006L9LC,"The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older. This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it).

I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress Conditioner&nbsp;for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible.

I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress&nbsp;conditioner and&nbsp;Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo&nbsp;(which had a scent I didn't like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  I replaced the shampoo with&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner.

I've tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me.

With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It's not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me.

Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I'm slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance.

The bottom line is using&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.

I'll update the review with observations about the ""strengthening"" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer.

First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner.

Update: Jan 9 2014
Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I'm now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.

What I'm using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it's like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.

Update: Feb 15 2015

I think I'm using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result.

Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.",Exceeded my Expectations - shiny and manageable,Citre Shine Moisture Burst Shampoo - 16 fl oz

Split ends are managed better.  Great smell too.  I use it with the Matrix conditioner (and I usually don't like conditioners) and it leaves my hair so soft but it doesn't lose its shape.

I'm not sure why I've gone out of my way to avoid this particular razor for the past 40 years--probably because of its dorky looks.  Face it, it's just not very ""masculine"" in its appearance--more ovarian than phallic, more like the grail than the lance.  But if you're willing to sacrifice form to function, this razor can't be beat.  It's the first one that caught every single hirsute strand on my neck in a single pass.

If you're beardless and unmustachioed, the Norelco is a bonafide no-brainer.  If you've got a number of hedges to trim around, the Norelco doesn't give you as clear a view or precise a cut as a more conventionally shaped Braun, Remington, or Panasonic.  On the other hand, the pop-out trimmer is the best I've ever seen, perfect for weeding out, pruning, shaping those less accessible areas.

As for spending fifteen to twenty bucks more for the next higher model (6843XL), the only difference I can see is color (blue instead of silver metallic) and a faster charging time (perhaps useful to those testosterone-rich individuals who require a shave every hour).",Norelco rocks,Philips Norelco 6613X Reflex Plus Rechargeable Cordless Men's Shaving System

4.0,A2DG9F8YOXNY7Y,B00009RB12,"The 7825XL, 7845XL, 7865XL and 7885XL models are all basically the same razor, differing only in the way they display battery/charging  status (anywhere from 1 LED to a complete tiny LCD display).  The shaving peformance is fine for me -- not as close as a wet shave but that's a good thing for me personally because the closeness of wet shaves makes my face break out.  Every 3-7 years I buy a new Norelco and they get incrementally better each time.

I'm writing to warn about one feature.  Every shaver I'd had up to this one had a physical slider switch to turn it on and off.  This models has a push button.  This means you can't tell BY TOUCH whether it's on or off.  This is critical for me because I usually shave in the car (sitting in traffic) with the stereo blaring and I can't hear the shaver (especially since the newer models are pretty quiet).  I turn it on and off a lot as traffic conditions change.

Further, when the battery is low, my previous shavers would just run slower and slower until they came to a gradual stop.  This one slows slightly (imperceptably to me, really) and then just ""falls off the cliff"" and stops cold.  So you don't get any warning really that it's about to run out -- if I knew it was running down, then I'd shave a lot faster!

And this is where the tactile power switch feedback is important:  if the battery's totally drained, but I'm not done yet, I'll leave it off for a minute and then turn it on for 5-10 seconds of shaving before it dies again.  With the push-button power control this is really confusing because you're never really sure what's on and off.  It turns out the the power button is like a pulse that gets sent to an internal microcontroller (I'm guessing), so after it's been off for a while the power ""position"" doesn't matter, it's really off.  You just push to reboot the thing.

So, my 7825XL was robbed out of my car last night and I'm buying another one of these, so I guess that's an endorsement.  But I'm bumping up to the next higher model with better battery status indication ...",good shave; don't like the power switch,Norelco Mens Electric Razor - 7845XL

4.0,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B0000C4KJV,"As any dental health professional will attest to, flossing one's teeth is just as important as brushing, and perhaps more so, for the bacteria that causes gum disease (and to a certain extent cavities) almost always starts between the teeth. Daily flossing breaks up the film of harmful bacteria and allows it to be removed.  Therefore, as a dentist, I am always stressing the importance of daily flosing to my patients.  My advice is this:

1.  Choose a floss that is comfortable to you and is the right thickness for your teeth.  Some people prefer floss holders rather than wrapping the floss around the fingers, while others prefer thin flavored floss to waxed thick floss. There are so many options - choose the right one for you.

2.  Waxed floss is ""waxed"" to allow easier passage between the teeth.  Waxed floss is no more effective than unwaxed at removing the bacterial film build-up. The important thing is to floss!

3.  Floss once daily, preferably before brushing.  Flossing breaks up the film of bacteria between the teeth in areas a toothbrush cannot reach.  It is important to then brush the teeth and rinse between the teeth to remove the film of bacteria that the flossing has dislodged.  Without brushing or rinsing after flossing, the bacteria can reattach to the teeth.

4.  Try to tie in flossing with another habit, such as watching the 10 PM news.  I know it sounds strange, but incorporating flossing into another habit leads one into developing a new habit.  Some complain that they don't have time to floss; well, if flossing is tied into another habit, such as watching TV, both can easily be done concurrently.

5.  There are many gimmicks the manufacturers use to sell their particular brand of floss.  Some flavor the floss, some incorporate fluoride into the strands of floss, and some make their floss more slippery for folks with tight contacts.  Whatever the case, the most important point is to choose a floss variety you will use regularly.  It is the mechanical act of removing the bacterial flim that is the important part, not the flavoring or chemical additions to the floss.

6.  If you want to keep your teeth for a life-time, develop the flossing habit.  As one wise sage said: ""If you ignore your teeth, they will eventually go away"".

I recommend this product, but it must be used regularly to be effective.

4.0,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B0001WXTPA,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth. However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions exactly as specified inside the box.

1. First brush your teeth with a wet toothbrush to remove the layer of plaque (toothpaste is unnecessary). Rinse your teeth well with water.  Tooth enamel has pores, and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate.

2. Use the strips as directed on the box.  The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide; (in-office, or dentist-assisted dental whitening uses a 15-35% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white. Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2. Leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth, as this leads to sensitivity.

Disadvantages

1. Hydrogen Peroxide can ""burn"" your gums. If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn). Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to want to stop the treatment. It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal. Once they are healed, resume treatment with the White Strips. Try to not get the strip on your gums.

2. Your teeth may become senstiive during the week treatment time. Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off. You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc.  The peroxide causes an inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.  If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching.

3. The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach. You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth. Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal. However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.

4. The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains. If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.

Now comes the confusing part: Crest White Strips come in 4 different packages, each a bit different than the others.  The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  Here are the 4 packages:  1. Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  2. Crest White Strips Premium (10% hydrogen peroxide, 7-day treatment).  3. Crest White Strips Premium Plus (10% hydrogen peroxide, and has 12 additional strips).  4. Crest White Strips Renewal (9.5% hydrogen peroxide).  The cheapest method (at around 25 dollars, is the Crest Classic Whitestrips, but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment).  Premium and Premium Pro are both 10% peroxide formulations, work in 7-10 days, and the ""Premuim-Plus"" gives you 12 additional strips.  I am not sure why Crest recently came out with ""Renewal"", as it is a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10% concentration. Leave it to the manufacturer to confuse the consumer!

Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.  White Strips don't work as fast as a dentist-made custom tray bleaching, (or in-office bleaching) but over time, you will get a result that will be close to that of a dentist, and you will save money too.

I recommend starting with with either the Classic or the Premium-Pro. The Classic works in 2 weeks and is about $1.80 a day.  The Premium Pro works in 10 days and is about $2 dollars a day.  The Premium and Premium Pro are likely to give you more sensitivity than the Classic.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching using a custom-tray system or in-office bleaching.  This is much more expensive, but the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is much higher and this tends to work better on stubbornly-stained teeth.

I am not sure why Crest recently came out with ""Renewal"", as it is a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10% concentration. Leave it to the manufacturer to confuse the consumer!

Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.  White Strips don't work as fast as a dentist-made custom tray bleaching, (or in-office bleaching) but over time, you will get a result that will be close to that of a dentist, and you will save money too.

I recommend starting with with either the Classic or the Premium-Pro. The Classic works in 2 weeks and is about $1.80 a day.  The Premium Pro works in 10 days and is about $2 dollars a day.  The Premium and Premium Pro are likely to give you more sensitivity than the Classic.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching using a custom-tray system or in-office bleaching.  This is much more expensive, but the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is much higher and this tends to work better on stubbornly-stained teeth.

5.0,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0001WXTPA,"The Crest Whitestrips do reveal good results, but if you drink tea or coffee, you are fighting an uphill battle. Instead of whitening your teeth all at once (although that is a good option at the start) you may want to keep these around for occasional touch ups, important occassions and feel good moods.

The strips for upper and lower teeth are easy to use and don't seem to promote as much tooth sensitivity as other whitening procedures (like with the annoying gel). In fact, it almost seems to make your gums more healthy than before.

Probably the most pleasant whitening experience on the market with fairly good results. Why the box has a mirror in it, we will never know unless it is useful to see the results of the whitening. It would be difficult to hold the box and put the strips on your teeth.

I'd recommend trying these and then keeping a box handy for touch up use. Probably will whiten your teeth one or two shades on the first use.

4.0,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B0001WXTPA,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth. However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions exactly as specified inside the box.

1. First brush your teeth with a wet toothbrush to remove the layer of plaque (toothpaste is unnecessary). Rinse your teeth well with water.  Tooth enamel has pores, and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate.

2. Use the strips as directed on the box.  The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide; (in-office, or dentist-assisted dental whitening uses a 15-35% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white. Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2. Leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth, as this leads to sensitivity.

Disadvantages

1. Hydrogen Peroxide can ""burn"" your gums. If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn). Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to want to stop the treatment. It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal. Once they are healed, resume treatment with the White Strips. Try to not get the strip on your gums.

2. Your teeth may become senstiive during the week treatment time. Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off. You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc.  The peroxide causes an inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.  If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching.

3. The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach. You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth. Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal. However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.

4. The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains. If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.

Now comes the confusing part: Crest White Strips come in 4 different packages, each a bit different than the others.  The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  Here are the 4 packages:  1. Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  2. Crest White Strips Premium (10% hydrogen peroxide, 7-day treatment).  3. Crest White Strips Premium Plus (10% hydrogen peroxide, and has 12 additional strips).  4.

Matte mauve pink. Gorgeous for everyday adds a natural looking flush to the cheeks. It is lighter than MAC slave to love blush which was one of my old favorites before I tried NARS!
2. Taos
Described as a dusty rose, but has coral tones on my skin tone. Has some shimmer but not very noticeable once applied to the skin. This one is very long lasting. Nice for brightening up your day...and your complexion!
3. Taj mahal
Looks very gold in the pan but adds such a pretty warmth to the cheeks that's a little shimmery and lit from within. There are many ravs about this blush on beauty blogs and YouTube and its true!
4. Desire
A scary bright bright bright pink in the pan but also very good quality giving cheeks the natural flush you crave for everyday. I've also seen this one on deeper skin tones and it still looks natural and flattering
5. Love joy
I was wondering if this would show up or just look like shimmer on my skin. After application it was a brownish berry color with slight shimmer and the blush I choose when I'm doing a strong smoky or colorful eye look. Looks very natural on my skin tone. Can't really be used to contour because it has the berry tone. The nars site describes this of a bronzed rose but on skin tones similar to mine would be berry toned.
6. Exhibit A
I've seen this on light medium and deep skin tones and it is widely flattering! Turns more red than orange on my skin but can look more orange on you depending on your undertones. Every woman should have this one in their arsenal. Some people believe this gives the most natural looking flush of all. It also photographs really well and looks good on video! Lol :)

Start your collection with any one of these if you're skin tone is similar to mine. NARS blush is one of the best blush brands out there I encourage you to try at least one even thought they have a higher price point. They are very pigmented and last a long time too!

But this one, not good for me. Not in any way.
If you already have some kind of 'orange' vibe going on, you probably want to steer away from this one. I am pasty pale with auburn/copper red hair, this just made me look like the Wendy's sign. It was not good with my base coloring.

I gave it 3 because no matter that the color looks bad on me, the product quality is still there. This would look incredible on someone with pigment in their skin, I'm almost envious of anyone who could wear this, just because it's so pretty in the pan. If you are darker than 'fresh death', this color will probably work on you. Just like any other NARS blush, a light hand will go a lot farther than digging in. You can always add to, but woe be to you if you put on too much of this stuff right off the bat.",Not good if you already have orange going on...,"NARS Blush, Taj Mahal"

I am very pale, and have auburn/reddish hair. This color SHOULD in theory look pretty spiffy on me, but I can't get past the fact that it looks like a GLITTERBOMB exploded on my face. What the ..>?!?!?!?!? And easy to overdo? Yes indeed! This blush is very very silky and soft; use a light hand. You can always add more but woe be to anyone who overapplies it.

UPDATE: I have the Orgasm/Laguna duo (reviews and photos and comparisons to other products coming soon) and it has been sitting ever since my horrifying discovery out in daylight, that there were glitter bits on my face from using the Orgasm blush. I have since discovered---your brush makes a LOT of difference. I switched to a very fluffy Real Techniques brush instead of my usual blush brush; it deposited gentle color and the glitter was very iffy. (As in, you couldn't really see obvious glitter but if you were verycloselikethis you could see tiny bits) I have revised my review a little bit. Still giving the advice that it's easy to overapply and, this color is sure not for everyone, but I don't want to shoot it with a silver bullet any more. If your skin has any tendency towards redness at all, I implore you to do a test run with this before you count on it looking good for any important (or public) event!

5.0,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B00021DJ32,"Some of the colors look scary in the compact because they are so highly pigmented. Exhibit A, for example, is a bright clownish looking orange-red that surely has scared off many a gal. But for those who know how to use a blush brush properly (ie, high quality bristles, good construction, a judicious amount of pressure, good blending), these babies pay off. And I mean pay off not just in beautiful color, but in how long they last, because this quality and pigmentation means you don't need to use a lot. One of these can last you a long, long time, even with daily use.

I have Exhibit A, Torrid, Taos, Crazed, Luster, and Mata Hari, which covers a range of warm and cool tones. Exhibit A is my fave go to red blush. Using just a touch of my duo-fibre MAC brush on it (ie MAC 187 brush), this deposits a beautiful, face-brightening blush to the cheeks. Too much and you look like Bozo, so this does require restraint.

Mata Hari is a lovely, feminine, cool pink-rose tone that I, who have olive skin, can wear and look like I was out walking briskly. Those two are my fave ones from NARS as they are matte. The others have some shimmer and require even more care in application and go well with a shiny gloss on the lips.

Luster is more like a highlighting color for me (it's a goldeny-lustrous color on me). It's pretty much the color of my skin with shimmer, so I can put it on without a color payoff, but it gives a nice glow that I like for days when I look ""tired"". A perking up thing. Also nice for adding glow when going out at night/to a party. On a lighter person, it's probably a nice warmth on the cheeks, sort of like a subtle bronzer. Could probably highlight eyes, all over, too. It's versatile.

Crazed is a deep raspberry pink with shimmer (ie, a cooler color that has glowiness). Taos is like a somewhat warm deep rosed-up red. It's a color that will definitely suit darker tones, but can be used by fairer women with much restraint. Torrid is a gorgeous deep peachy sort of tone with shimmer. I'm wearing it today with Manhunt by NARS (lipstick) overlaid with Red Devil coral-red gloss by MAC. Torrid is not as deeply-intense as Crazed or Taos, but it's not a shy color either. Will give a nice payoff.

I'm med-dark olive toned (NC44 in MAC) and all those look fine on me. I'm ordering Gilda to add to the peachy colors in my blush collection (which right now includes two MAC peachy tones and one by Physician's Formula). With summer coming in, I'm looking for peachier/warmer tones.

These are expensive-ish, but these are top-notch, and it's no wonder makeup artists and celebrities love NARS blushes. (Note: I don't own the much-touted, much-beloved, nearly legendary Orgasm, though, which is more suited to ligther-than-me gals, but it really is pretty in the pan. I have heard good things about Super Orgasm colorwise, if you don't mind having chunks of glitter fall off your brush.)

UPDATE: I got my Gilda blush and it's lovely. A soft-textured, nicely-pigmented matte peach that will look fabulous with peachy-coral and more orangey glosses for Spring and summer, or even with nude glosses.","Among the absolute BEST blushes out there--beautiful colors, blendability, durability","NARS Blush, Taj Mahal"

ORGASM may be the holy grail of blusher for many fairer women, but I'm an NC44 Latina (med-dark olive tone) and that color would not make a showing on me. I did find that two colors have become my staple blushes.

For warm-tone days, I use EXHIBIT A, a matte blush that is scary in the pan (so brightly orange-red) that most women would think ""Bozo the Clown"". No, it works beautifully on my tone, brightening me (we olive toned women can look sallow and blah without a color pop). Fabulous.

For cool days (and by cool I'm talking my color choices for clothes and lipstick, not weather), I like  MATA HARI. It's a matte cool pink tone that is deep enough to show on my cheeks and give me a look that says ""Healthful"" or ""just went for a quick jog and has blood circulating well"". Nice.

I plan to try CRAZED and TAOS, which seem to be shimmery cousins to my two faves (ie, one is warmer, one is cooler).

I think the thing is to head to a store like Sephora and just try the shades. With the array of beautiful colors, you will find a couple or more colors that make you feel and look great.

NOTE: You really need a quality brush to get just enough pigment and deposit not too much pigment. That's my recommendation. These blushes do not come with little cheapo rough brushes like so many do. No, get a good blush brush--a MAC one, or a Sephora, etc. I use the MAC duo-fiber brush, smaller one, and it works very well with these strong shades.

Yes, pricey. But I've gone through so many disappointing blushes in drugstore brands and even from some name brands, that it's a relief to find blushers that WORK for me and make me happy and don't make me itch!

Hurrah for NARS.

I am a mother of twin toddlers, skin, hair changed after hormone changes and I have had quite a difficult time trying to find what would suit my skin.

I have the crows lines, and a few lines on my forehead.

I used both the eye serum and face moiture cream and it goes on so easy, very light and very moisturizing.  I noticed that my face is no longer dry, not oily, just perfect to where is should be.  Skin does get tight as advertised, but not in a way where your face is burning or dry.  Just taught.

It is worth every penny. Don't be surprised by the size, it lasts a LONG time. A little cream can cover your whole face.

4.0,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B0009MFZAE,"I am a dentist who recommends Crest-brand White Strips to my patients becasue they do work to whiten teeth. However, they have to be used correctly and I recommend that you follow the directions exactly as specified inside the box.

1. First brush your teeth with a wet toothbrush to remove the layer of plaque (toothpaste is unnecessary). Rinse your teeth well with water.  Tooth enamel has pores, and the pores need to be open for the chemical to penetrate.

2. Use the strips as directed on the box.  The instructions will tell you to bleach twice a day for 30-minutes a time.  The inner part of the strip has a chemical called hydrogen peroxide; (in-office, or dentist-assisted dental whitening uses a 15-35% version of the same chemical) that causes the stains inside your teeth to be oxidized and turn white. Applying the strips has a small learning curve as you will probably bend or fold a couple of them before you get the technique down.

2. Leave the strips on for the time recommended in the instructions and do not overbleach your teeth, as this leads to sensitivity.

Disadvantages

1. Hydrogen Peroxide can ""burn"" your gums. If you notice a burning sensation when you use the product, it is the chemical oxidizing (or burning) your gums (it will turn them white with a minor chemical burn). Depending on how severe the burning is, it may cause you to want to stop the treatment. It is OK to stop the treatment for a day or two to let the gums heal. Once they are healed, resume treatment with the White Strips. Try to not get the strip on your gums.

2. Your teeth may become senstiive during the week treatment time. Try to tolerate the sensitivity if it is mild, but if more severe, take a day or two off to let the teeth settle down and then pick up where you left off. You may notice much more sensitivity to cold water, ice cream, etc.  The peroxide causes an inflamation of the inner pulp, or nerve center of the tooth and makes the teeth very sensitive to biting or cold drinks or foods.  If your teeth become too sensitive, back off on the strips until the sensitivity is gone before resuming bleaching.

3. The strips only cover your front teeth, so only your front teeth will bleach. You may notice the distinct difference between the back (unbleached) teeth and the front (bleached) teeth. Since most people notice the front 6 teeth anyway, this is not a big deal. However, if you have a wide toothy smile, you may want to have a dentist make you a tray that will hold the chemical on the back teeth to whiten them too.

4. The bleaching effect works best on yellow stains. If your stains are due to tetracycline (brownish grey stains in a band on your teeth, your best bet is to have a dentist whiten your teeth as the dentist will use a tray to hold a more concentrated form of the chemical on your teeth for a longer period of time.

Now comes the confusing part: Crest White Strips come in 4 different packages, each a bit different than the others.  The main difference is in the strength of the hydrogen peroxide, and the price.  The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the most costly the product package.  Here are the 4 packages:  1. Crest White Strips Classic (6% hydrogen peroxide, 14-day treatment).  2. Crest White Strips Premium (10% hydrogen peroxide, 7-day treatment).  3. Crest White Strips Premium Plus (10% hydrogen peroxide, and has 12 additional strips).  4. Crest White Strips Renewal (9.5% hydrogen peroxide).  The cheapest method (at around 25 dollars, is the Crest Classic Whitestrips, but it takes 2 weeks to complete the treatment).  Premium and Premium Pro are both 10% peroxide formulations, work in 7-10 days, and the ""Premuim-Plus"" gives you 12 additional strips.  I am not sure why Crest recently came out with ""Renewal"", as it is a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide formulation which is not significantly different from the 10% concentration. Leave it to the manufacturer to confuse the consumer!

Crest White Strips work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains.  White Strips don't work as fast as a dentist-made custom tray bleaching, (or in-office bleaching) but over time, you will get a result that will be close to that of a dentist, and you will save money too.

I recommend starting with with either the Classic or the Premium-Pro. The Classic works in 2 weeks and is about $1.80 a day.  The Premium Pro works in 10 days and is about $2 dollars a day.  The Premium and Premium Pro are likely to give you more sensitivity than the Classic.  Be sure and check out the price of each kit, as they vary from store to store.  Obviously, get the cheapest kit that supplies the same amount of strips.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated form of bleaching using a custom-tray system or in-office bleaching.  This is much more expensive, but the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is much higher and this works better on stubbornly-stained teeth.

3.0,AGEKVD8JPZQMT,B0009MFUN6,"I am giving this 3 stars although mine is broken.  Let me tell you about the good first.  The cleaning system is pretty cool, and works well.  I just wish the liquid didn't evaporate so quickly.    But it being part alcohol - that makes sense that it evaporates.  The shave is close, although rough on the skin.  The head doesn't move as smoothly along my face as my old norelco.  Another positive is that is uses the same recharging cable as my old norelco (I think all norelco chargers are the same).

Now the bad.  At home, this razor was perfect.  It has about 80 minutes of juice in it and i only need to charge it about once every 3 months, since I have a secondary norelco I keep in my gym bag and use that one when I'm at work.  My secondary battery finally wouldn't hold a charge, so I had to replace it with my new 9170XLCC.  Well, every time I would take it out of my gym bag, the head would be popped open.  This is because the button to open the head actually sticks out from the body, and anything can snag it and it will spring open.  You don't even need to 'press' the button, you just need to touch it.  Well, today it was, as usual, popped open.  The only difference now is that it won't close.  It probably twisted a little while in the open position and now the blades are unaligned with the head, and it won't snap shut.  I can get a piece of tape and tape it shut, which works, but that is not the point.  Norelco had done a great job before by creating a recessed button on my old razor, but now this button that sticks out can snag on anything.  Not only is it bad in the sense that the head can twist when popped open, but I also have little hairs all over the bottom of my bag because it kept popping open.

So that's my review - it worked as a razor, but don't plan on travelling with it.  Even when you place it in a glove box/cupholder, that head will manage to pop open.  It was a poor design flaw and I'm very disappointed that norelco would send something out like this without any type of travel-testing.  I mean, what's the point of a cordless razor if you can't take it anywhere with you?",It works as a shaver but . . .,Philips Norelco 9170XLCC Smart Touch XL Shaver

I first found it online by doing a search for things with pumpkin in it, and now I'm on my 4th bottle of this and I also recommend the body lotion and face creams, I am slowly becoming totally enamored with this brand and always look forward to trying more things.

This wash beats soap anytime in the shower; the orange gelee collapses on itself when poured and feels cool and refreshing especially in the morning. I love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. There is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing Dead Sea water and even spirulina extract, which I have drank before but never used in products. It feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. The bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.

As I get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. Parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately I keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy.

4.0,A2BVRKJ12P1HDY,B000A23CQM,"Hi, My name is Michael.  I live near Baton Rouge, LA.  I'm 43 and I have shaved with Norelco Electric Razors for years.  I had 3 SpectraXLs that went out within a month of shaving.  I also had a Cool Skin that went out within a month of shaving.  Norelco replaced the Spectras and I have a 8894XL that I have been shaving with for about 6 months and it works fine.  I took the money that I got back from the Cool Skin and put it towards a Smart Touch 9160XL.  I was really surprised to learn that Norelco was discontinuing the Spectra line.  8894XL is one fine shaving machine, beautiful design and well constructed, with the kinks ironed out, it's the best shaving electric razor Norelco has ever made up to now.  I say up to now.  Smart Touch is not the razor that Spectra is.  It is cheaply made and not as well constructed.  To me, Norelco has made a step backwards by discontinuing Spectra, but Smart Touch does slightly out shave Spectra and that is the main reason to buy this razor.  I have a heavy dark beard and I work 12 hour shifts at the end of my day with Smart Touch, I hardly have a shadow, AWESOME!!!!!  Something, I've never experienced with an electric razor!!!!  9160XL is good enough, unless you want to put down about $200 more for all the bells and whistles, when 9160XL shaves just as good as 9190XL.  I usually use Williams Electric Shave, but this morning I used some Pinaud Clubman Talc as a pre electric and I got the closest shave that I have ever gotten with an electric razor!!!!  Pos.- There are 3 heads on this Razor ( Something that Spectra does not have ), making for a closer shave, It has a personal comfort control with 3 settings, line bar to show you how much charge you have left, and it can be eaisly washed out after each shave, and it give the closest possible shave that you will ever  get with an electric razor.  Neg.- This razor is not of the same qualty as Spectra.  It is cheaply made and not as awesome as Spectra.  The cleaning indicator is useless.  It blinks after every shave, not when the razor needs to be cleaned.  The little travel pouch is a joke!!  The razor barely fits in it.  I almost took mine back, but I stuck with it for a couple of days and found that I really was getting the closest shave that I had ever gotten with an electric razor, so I kept mine.  Go ahead and buy this razor.  Don't waste your money on the higher priced models.  I'm sure this one shaves just as good, but be sure to save your sales slip in case it goes out.

4.0,A58F10T4OE58C,B000EG8HLE,"This product works exactly as it says it will.  I was pretty skeptical, but it gives a close shave with minimal irritation.  And no exposed blades to snag sensitve bits.
Being able to use it in or out of the shower is a real plus, though it seems to work better dry.

Update:
With the amount of hair I have, I guess it's no surprise that this thing won't last a life time.  I dropped my first BG one too many times in the shower and it finally gave out.
Of course this product is so great at what it does, that it was a no brainer to replace it.
The only complaint I have about the BodyGroom is how delicate the foil guard is.  It is very easy to get bent or dented, and when that happens, you can get some unexpected snagging from the cutting blades.  The best way to prevent any damage to the foil (which incidentally, is not covered by the warranty), is to be very careful when removing and disassembling the unit to clean it.

Now in terms of performance--this thing can plow through a lot of hair, but works better if you keep up with your trimming regularly.  If you are doing a particular hairy part, like your legs, clip them dry and be sure to tap out the hair that gets caught up in the shaver head regularly.

The guards are basically useless and will frustrate you if you are trying to do any type of styling (say, shaved down to the skin on your torso, but leaving a little longer happy trail).  More times than not, I just ditch the guards and take it all o

I'm not too upset by the death of my Bodygroom - while I had hoped it would last longer it wasn't very expensive to start with so I'll order another one.  Why?  Because it gets the job done.

Yes, the guard clogs with hair quickly.  That's why I use it in the shower...makes cleanup much easier!  If I trim too quickly the guard comes off but fortunately I haven't shaved a bare swath across my chest...yet.

As for the more sensitive areas, well, it works well there too without pain - if you're careful.  It's easy to get the wrong angle and have the trimmer blade (that cuts with the guard) contact skin.  Work slowly to ensure only the center touches skin.

3.0,A331BHAR0TRLWT,B000EGMC74,"I originally bought this cleansing cream to remove makeup and dirt like a cold cream. I have been stripping my face using harsh cleansers and wanted to ease up yet still get rid of makeup at night. This cream kind of confuses me. It does seem to remove makeup, including mascara and liner, well. But then I end up having to wash my face after because it leaves an oily residue which is not good for my skin. It's mineral oil  which is like a barrier which keeps moisture out but, at the same time, keeps it in as well.  It forms a sort of seal between your skin and anything you put on it and anything that is under it. Anyone who is prone to clogged pores will probably break out if they leave this on their skin.

However, this brand is certainly not the only cream cleanser to use mineral oil as its main hydrator and cleanser. When I use this Queen Helene Cream, I always rinse it off so I am still washing my face like I was but at least the product is hydrating and not harsh. It doesn't strip my face of its natural oils and, when I wash it off with a warm washcloth, my face feels soft.

But what I really wanted was a no rinse cleanser for those lazy nights when I want to remove make up and dirt and hydrate all in one step. I may be able to leave this on my skin and not have issues but I prefer to remove the oil and use something a little more aging skin friendly. Still, if you're looking for a creamy cleanser that gets the job done and is cheap, this does work.

This is by no means solid coca butter. It has *some* cocoa butter in it but it's a ways down the ingredients list. It is more mineral oil,  petroleum. and paraffin which are the first three ingredients. It is very solid, like a candle. In fact, I dumped the tub over accidentally and the whole thing fell out of the tub in one solid piece. I picked it up and put it back in. It looks like a candle, yellow and nearly opaque. It is very greasy and very, very hard. You can't dip your finger into the tub and scoop some out. You have to sort of scrape the sides to get some of the waxy stuff out of there.

On my skin, it is greasy. It has a great scent though I must say. I guess it's cocoa buttery. The fragrance is artificial. I bought this cream for my hands as they are really dry in the winter but this is way too greasy for use anytime but at night with gloves on. It does remove makeup on my face decently although it is certainly not my preferred method. It's not bad on my lips but has a strange taste. I am desperately trying to find a use for this stuff. I think that the description should be much clearer because this simply is NOT cocoa butter at all. It is misleading to label it that way.

Suffice it to say that this is a very well priced shaver/trimmer that has all the attachments one could want for everything from trimming hair, to that of your nose and ears as well.  It's small, easy to hold and handle, and shaped in such a way that makes even doing ones back of the neck easy.  It charges up quickly and lasts long enough to do several trimming jobs before you need to plug it in again.  About the only couple of things I can say I don't like about this trimmer is there is no stand that comes with it for storing it upright in between charges. (but they do give you a little nylon bag to store all the attachments in). That wouldn't be so bad, save for the fact that the trimmers bottom is very small and it tips over easily when you just set it down upright.  It would have been nice if they either offered a little stand to store it in, or made the base of the unit a little bigger for stability.  The other is a minor irritant, but one that I am sure many will well identify with.  The instruction booklet is not a booklet at all but one of those big thin fold out papers like the the old road maps.  Its in 40 languages like everything is these days and its very difficult to read it when all spread out and follow it in English or any other language.

5.0,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B000FED5DU,"This Norelco ""G370 All-in-1 Grooming System"" has held up remarkably well with fairly heavy usage over the past three years. I keep a very short beard and mustache (see my ""Profile"" picture) so do a trim every two or three days. Since I am also getting older, there is now a lot more hair where there aught not to be hair (ears, nose, eyebrows, etc) and fortunately this set has attachments to handle all of those needs.

The set comes with the handy caddy tray that holds the attachments and the charger cord can be connected through the bottom so the trimmer recharges when it is seated. The trimmer can easily run through three or four of my sessions without needing to be recharged, which is great when traveling since it is often not necessary to bring my whole kit along.

My only real issue with the trimmer is that with the spacer attached the hair gets crammed down in between the attachment and trimmer body, making it messy to clean out.

5.0,A6FIAB28IS79,B000FEF1VE,"I resisted Norelcos for over 40 years because, frankly, I thought the rotary head looked ""dorky""--especially compared to the more masculine, phallic, lance-like Remingtons and Schicks.  Then I tried the least expensive Norelco model and experienced a completely clean shave for the first time in my life.  I was happy with that model, but it's managed to disappear, leading me to the 7240XL, which Amazon inexplicably had priced at $15-20 below the ""less deluxe,"" cosmetically blue 7140XL.  Small wonder that they sold out.  You may wish to wait to see if it's restocked at its former price, or simply elect to pay the higher freight.

This Norelco is more shaver than I need--slightly heavier and bigger than my previous, entry-level model, and it has a curious but I assume functional plastic ""shield"" (hair-catcher?).  Also, the trimmer is noisier (and ""sounds"" less powerful) than its predecessor.  But it delivers the same flawless performance and has niceties such as water-wash clean (I hardly dare to use it), adjustability to the curvature of the face, and automatic voltage selection.  The less expensive models offer the same, though the 7240XL is slightly more ""ergonomic"" (with the inclusion of a thumb and finger rest).  If you can forego the thumb rest and live with blue instead of silver, the 7140XL will serve you just as well, I'm sure, and currently at a significantly lower price (Amazon apparently caught on and adjusted the formerly upside-down pricing of the two models).",Less of a value but still the best.,Philips Norelco 7240XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver

Not that this one is expensive, but the 7240XL is an outstanding deal at present.  Basically, the differences are purely external and cosmetic.

For me, that's a 5 star feature.  My husband's only complaint is that it's a little bulky because of this feature and that when he wants to trim around his mustache or ears he can't just pull off the plastic guard like he could with his old Panasonic so the blades are exposed, but has to replace the guard with a smaller head that has exposed blades that made for this purpose.

Some reviewers have complained about the noise but to me it seems about average as far as sound goes.  It doesn't wake me up if the bathroom door is open to the bedroom and I'm still asleep.

I switched to electric razors a few years ago when my face couldn't handle blades anymore. I thought I'd have to sacrifice a close shave in order to get a healthier face but this hasn't been the case with this shaver. The shave is almost as close as a blade and I have absolutely no irritation. I upgraded to one of the speed XL models and this one is slightly slower, but not so bad.

There are only 2 downsides: It takes 8 hours to charge and you can't use it corded. This is not that big of a deal though since you'll still have plenty of time to finish when the low battery indicator goes off.

At this point I couldn't recommend this shaver if you have already used a rotary and know you like them and for a very simple reason: it is obsolete and buying replacement heads is almost as much as a new razor.

Each time I visit that store, I always check to see if more of this wonderful lotion has come in, but so far, it hasn't.  The price in the store was much less than what it is being sold for on Amazon.com.

I first found it online by doing a search for things with pumpkin in it, and now I'm on my 4th bottle of this and I also recommend the body lotion and face creams, I am slowly becoming totally enamored with this brand and always look forward to trying more things.

This wash beats soap anytime in the shower; the orange gelee collapses on itself when poured and feels cool and refreshing especially in the morning. I love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. There is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing Dead Sea water and even spirulina extract, which I have drank before but never used in products. It feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. The bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.

As I get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. Parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately I keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy. And I love my cosmetics almost as much as books, the bathroom is always stacked : )

This wash smells like the salty ocean water, sunscreen lotion, sun, sand and a slight layer of milky fruit.

Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.

There slogan was "" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.

They want to improve profit margin.  The plastic is ok, but if there was a choice . . . I'd take glass.  #2  Whoever designed and then signed off on this horrid bottle should be fired. I suspect in the interest of getting the consumer to use more, the hole in the top of the bottle is too big.

5.0,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B000GGFZLC,"As a dentist, I have seen over and over again the destructive results of not flossing one's teeth. The unfortunate result of such neglect is the rapid development of cavities between the teeth (especially in kids), and inevitable gum disease in adults, which can lead to eventual tooth loss.  Gum disease almost always starts in-between the teeth, and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities between the teeth is with floss.  Mechanical scrubbing with floss is the key, and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not remove the in-between stubborn plaque below the gumline and at the contact point of the teeth. The bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep them for a lifetime.

Reach floss is thicker than the average floss. It will be more difficult to pass between teeth, but I like it because I find that it cleans my teeth better than the smaller diameter floss. This is a personal preference not based on any clinical data. Reach floss is not for everyone. Those with tight contacts will have trouble with Reach floss. This floss is waxed (easier to slide between teeth), and is unflavored.

If one's fingers get sore from flossing, there are various floss forks that one can load with this floss.  Using a floss fork is very effective and handy, as one does not have to get fingers in the mouth. Here is a good one I recommend:&nbsp;Flossaid Dental Floss Holder **ONE**

Floss each tooth contact with a gentle insertion of the floss between the teeth.  Gently scrub each tooth up and down and make sure to go under the gumline (as this is where gum disease germs get their start).  After flossing, it is a great time to brush.  Always use a fluoridated toothpaste for maximum protection of the teeth (fluoride makes the enamel crystal more resistant to acid destruction).

Just had my three month checkup and everything was sparkling clean around both the implant and my remaining teeth.

5.0,ABDR6IJ93HFIO,B000GLRREU,"For me, I have been using a cordless (non Waterpik brand) and while it has helped my gums, I wanted to step my gum treatment up a few notches so I purchased this Waterpik. It is TOTALLY AMAZING how well my gums are responding to this treatment. Here is a list below of the MANY PROS of this unit:

+ Effectiveness with my gums, teeth and mouth: After using this just a short time, my gums are getting more of that lighter pink and healthy look I need for my gum health. And they feel so clean after each use. In addition, my teeth even look cleaner! Love the fact that this has 10 different intensity levels. The one  five are very, very gentle on gums (great if you have tender or swollen gums or if you are new to Waterpik). However, I am up to power 8 on this and will be up to a 10 soon) and this intensity works wonderfully on my gums. They actually enjoy their beauty treatment so to speak.

+ Pause Button on the handle  This saves the day for me as when I want to pause, the button is at my fingertips and this helps me not to spray water all around my bathroom.

+ Ease of filling and cleaning - This unit is easy to fill, clean and empty and I like the fact that it is stationery in my bathroom and does not take much counter space.

+ Attachments and what is included  This comes with 6 attachments: Classic Jet Tip, Toothbrush Tip, Tongue Cleaner, Pik Pocket Tip (my favorite attachment as it is really helping my gums), Plaque Seeker Tip, and Orthodontic Tip.
In addition to the attachments, there is a Quick Start sheet to show you how to setup the Waterpik and also there is a small owners manual that has much information on how to use each attachment and how to overall use the Waterpik with pictures and step by steps.

+ Quality and Sound: This unit is almost whisper quiet as the motor is very smooth yet heavy duty at the same time. This is a very superbly made Waterpik!

5.0,A17IS2KTMUBJ52,B000GLRREU,"Cons:
Loud, sounds like Barbie handling a concrete drill.
Constantly sprays. The spraying, doesn't stop unless you press the blue button. To me, that's backwards. It should turn on when I press the handle button, but the real on button is on the side. However, you get used to it quick after you sprayed water everywhere a few times :D.
Can't replace flossing (unfortunately you'd need a sandblaster to replace string flossing, and that would be painful.)
Your mouth will fill with water quickly, so you have to spit multiple times (really not a big deal but took time to get used to.)

Pros:
Your mouth feels dentist clean!
It's fun in a gadgety way.
Easy to setup. The coil on the handle NEVER tangles.

4.0,A19MMYMZO363KM,B000GLRREU,Despite the off switch making it so much nicer than the original ones over 20 years ago...but I still manage to spray myself and the walls. I found that it didn't want to start working..or pumping actually when I attemped to prime it so to speak as the directions tell you. I set it up for that and after many minutes nothing happening. HUH...I was aware others wrote in that it was dead on arrival. But I could hear the pump being actively trying to work...just no water. So I ever so slightly lifted the corner the pump hole is on the water canister facing the pik it's on your left side towards the front corner...anyway I lifted it just a real tiny amount like maybe less than 1/4 inch or even no more than an 1/8 even. And a couple bubbles came up and I set it back down seating it again and the water came through right after that. So it was an air lock. That simple and that simple a fix but sometimes an airlock might be larger than the few small bubbles I had emerge. So you might have to work it a bit  maybe even shake it back and forth gentle of course. This kind of information might be helpful and prevent returns in the future. But the sellers need to realize this and tell you or warn you in the descriptions. Also Really WATERPIK should have this in it's brochure or manual as it is and tell you right off that it can occur.

5.0,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B000GLRREU,"When i was 16 my dentist told me to buy a Waterpik as an alternative to flossing which I didn't like then or now. Many years have past and I have shot through quite a few Waterpik models and this is the current one I own. It is a little more evolved than its predecessors, but it still performs in pretty much the same way it always has. You fill the reservoir with water, attach the head to the handle which has a control to turn the water stream on and off, and then turn the device on to produce a spray of water as you move the head around to remove debris from between your teeth and gums. I think of the Waterpik as a power washer for the teeth and gums because it forces out pressurized water to irrigate those areas.
This model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. It also comes with six different tips. While I use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.
Other than eliminating the need to floss, the Waterpik has been beneficial to me. My teeth are always clean, I don't have gum disease, plaque, dental decay, etc.

5.0,AIEEK7AHXKZCC,B000GLRREU,"I received this as a gift and just love it.  Make it your mouth, teeth and gums' best friend.  I had a much smaller water pick and although quite inexpensive, was decent enough.  It was a Yugo compared to this Lexus of water flossers!

First, read the instructions.  Start off with low pressure as this little pump can shoot out quite an aquatic projectile!  Just make sure you have the nozzle turned AWAY from your eyes.  NEVER let this anywhere near your eyes.  Once you have regulated the flow to where you want it, you are ready to enter a whole new world of oral health!

This little Godsend also comes with a tongue cleaner.  After you give yourself a good oral cleansing, you and your dentist will have entered into a new phase of your oral health partnership.  This is EXCELLENT for your tongue, teeth and gums and does a very thorough job.  You reduce placque and bacteria considerably and the water jet can reach places where dental floss never reaches.",Flowing With Oral Health,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser
4.0,A1EVV74UQYVKRY,B000GLRREU,"My 12 year old just got braces for the first time and the procedure to floss between his teeth was never going to happen. So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...",Good Waterpik with lots of Nozzle Choices,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser
5.0,A1QBOC76MIOJYP,B000GLRREU,"While this Waterpik is not a total alternative for traditional flossing, it sure does help a ton if you have braces! It saves sooo much time and effort. Honestly, if I use this and then use regular floss string afterward, I never have anything come out on the string. I love this Waterpik! My teeth feel so clean after using it.

It is easy to use. You just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. It is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! I use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. The different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. It flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. The coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.

I use a basin full of water, then refill with half water/half mouthwash and my mouth and teeth feel so clean and so smooth. It feels like I just left the dentist. It is also easy to clean from behind the teeth as well.

This is definitely one of the best investments I have made. I definitely recommend this wether you have braces or not. My kids even like using it. I bought extra heads for it so they each have their own and can just pop it on when they use the Waterpik.",A must have for braces!,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser

5.0,A2JCJJNY43QQIV,B000GLRREU,"I've always prided myself on my good teeth. I thought that flossing and brushing was enough...that was until I went to the dentist, and he said I had the beginnings of periodontal disease. That scared the hell out of me.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

5.0,A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,B000GLRREU,"This is an outstanding product!  I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!

To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.

I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).

The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.

Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.

The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.

In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.

Good performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.",Clean teeth and fresh breath!,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser
5.0,A6FIAB28IS79,B000H6A02A,"Unlike some previous reviewers comparing the two shavers, I haven't experienced hair-pulling or face-cutting problems with the Norelco, but the machine's quiet, unlabored operation frequently caused me to wonder if it was even running. More importantly, it made shaving around a beard too much of a ""guessing game.""  Especially if you try to maintain a consistent, even line between beard and skin at the neck, the Norelco leads to frustration--the line is constantly moving lower while becoming increasingly irregular.

Put simply, this Remington is the one to get if your face is of a hirsute nature. (Braun once won my allegiance--until I added up the cost of continually replacing those delicate, ripped foils).  The Remington MS2-390 is not only quite rugged but ergonomic, inexpensive, and darned effective.  As for the ""noise"" that many complain about, I've come to regard it as an all-business wake-up call, a high-pitched buzz of excitement confirming that the day's first task is under way--not to mention well in hand.

To extend the metaphor, the Norelco is a cumbersome, bloated bomber from the German Luftewaffe whereas the Remington is a British RAF Spitfire which, in the hands of a skilled pilot, can fly circles around any of the balky Teutonic Titans.

3.0,A1XCSAX4BRT89Y,B000H723LU,"My expectations for any anti-aging product are pretty modest.  I think that certain products can make your skin tone appear more even resulting in a brighter complexion, and skin that reflects light prettily tends to appear more youthful.  I do not think that there are any miracle creams out there that are going to make you look decades younger, and I find most of the hype surrounding many anti-aging products is just that - hype, with no science to back it up.  That being said...

SK-II is a well-known, high-end skin care line and I was excited to give it a try.  This product arrived without any instructions, which I find odd.  Does it replace your toner or do you use it after your toner?  I had to go online to the company's website to do a little research.  You apply this product to clean skin.  You can use a cotton pad or pat it into the skin with your hands.  It absorbs into my skin quickly and completely; there's no sticky feeling nor is it oily.  It has the consistency of water and a very slight (and not unpleasant) odor.  I experience no stinging, redness, irritation or breakouts.  This does leave my skin feeling a little tight, and I follow up with my usual daytime moisturizer and nighttime retinol cream.

After nearly four weeks of use (twice daily) I have to say that I've noticed absolutely no change in my skin whatsoever.  Now I'm pretty happy with my current skin care regimen, and it's entirely possible that what I'm using is effective and I'm not going to see any major changes by adding another product into the mix.

Bottom line:  Pleasant and easy to use; no unwanted side effects but also no noticeable improvement.

Would I recommend this product?  Hard to say.  Everyone's skin is different and I've read online testimonials by women who swear by this stuff.

+ The Brush Part - The center with the freshener is also like a tiny bit of toothpaste/mouthwash as my teeth,gums and overall mouth feel very clean after I use this. Still I REGULAR BRUSH and floss at least 2 - 3 times per day.

+ The Pick Part - Yes, the pick is a hard plastic, yet it is very thin and works just like a toothpick, yet better than a toothpick because there is no wood to break (I have broken so many toothpicks, so this is so so much better).

+ Other Uses I Have Found - Twice a day, I use PLAX Rinse before brushing and then begin my regular brushing with this tiny brush as it has firm enough bristles to flake off the Plaque and even some tartar. (The PLAX Rinse takes at least 2 weeks to really see hard tartar coming off by the way - yet this firm brush seems to help the process for me).

Plus, the lack of alcohol helps me deal with chronic dry mouth issues (alcohol rinses and mouthwashes make dry mouth much worse).

But how a rinse tastes is important since you'll be tasting it for some time after use. This was overly sweet rather than ""fresh mint"" tasting like other rinses (such as ACT). The aftertaste remained sweet to the point where it was unpleasant.

I'm was concerned about the potential for tooth staining. I've not had any issues with that so far with this rinse, but it was a concern.

I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to the mouthwash burn, so the strength of it is usually the first thing I notice when trying out a new mouthwash. My husband who seems immune to the strength of every mouthwash out there, seems fine with this Crest formula and has no problem washing with it. I haven't had any issues with this mouthwash turning my teeth colors or causing any kind of build, and neither has my mouthwash addicted husband. So it seems to work well. It leaves your breath smelling great and lasts quite a while. I like this wintergreen version a bit more than the mint, since I've always been a fan of the more refreshing taste of wintergreen.

One thing I do appreciate is that Crest did not use Yellow #5 food coloring to make this mouthwash, since most companies use that color to produce the green hue in their products (including Scope). Some people, myself included, have a sever food allergy to Yellow #5 and can't use or eat anything with that food coloring it it. For those with this condition, note that Crest has used Yellow #6 instead to create the mouthwashes green color. The Crest Pro-Heath mouth wash in the Invigorating Clean version, which is an even greener colored mouthwash, also doesn't use Yellow #5, and used #6. So anyone with this food coloring sensitivity who wants to try these out, can do so knowing these won't have Yellow #5 in them.",Wintergreen version for those who prefer it over mint,"Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Rinse, Cool Wintergreen, 33.8 Fluid Ounce"

5.0,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B000NSU25M,"Crest Whitestrips-Daily Multicare Formula is designed for ""maintenance"" bleaching, to maintain the whiteness of your teeth once the desired shade has been reached.  Therefore, one should use a Crest Strip product such as the entry-level system&nbsp;Classic Whitestrips-Crest Dental Whitening System, 56 Strips, or a stronger product like&nbsp;Crest Whitestrips Premium- 7- Day Dental Whitening Formula System, 28 Strips, before the Daily Multicare Formula is used.

This product is used for just 5 minutes a day to maintain the whiteness of bleached teeth. (All the other Crest Whitestrip products advise a 30-minute treatment once or twice a day protocol). Since there are 84 strips (42 upper/42 lower), this enough for a full 6 weeks of daily bleaching.
There are virtually no side-effects, such as sensitive teeth, or ""burned"" gums, as the contact time is just 5 minutes. This system has a 6% hydrogen peroxide gel, the same as Crest Classic Whitestrips.

An alternative to this product of daily bleaching maintenance is to use one of the original systems again, such as Classic Whitestrips for 1-2  weeks to restore the bleach white color of the teeth.

Crest White Strips come in as many as 7 different formulations, which can be quite confusing to the consumer.  Please remember the key difference in all these products is the strength of the hydrogen peroxide gel, and of course the price. The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the faster the bleaching result, and the most costly as well.  Here is a quick summary of the products:

1. Crest White Strips Classic.  This is Crest's first bleaching product, introduced in 2001.  It has a 6% hydrogen peroxide gel, and is applied twice a day for 30 minutes for 14-days of treatment.  It is still a very popular product, and perhaps offers the lowest number of side-effects.

2. Crest White Strips Premium came out in 2004.  It is a 10% hydrogen peroxide gel, applied twice a day for 30 minutes each session, for 7-days of treatment. The 10% hydrogen peroxide strength offers a quicker bleaching result, but perhaps with more tooth and gum sensitivity.

3.  Crest Pro Effects came out in 2008. It is another 10% hydrogen peroxide gel, but offers a 10-day treatment protocol - again, twice a day for 30 minutes each time.

4. Crest Advanced Seal is the latest product (February, 2009), and it also has a 10% hydrogen peroxide, twice a day, 30-minutes a day, 10-day treatment. The main advantage to this system is that the strip is more adherent to the teeth, and the user can talk, exercise, drive, be active, even drink fluids, with the strip in place.  The other systems advise the user to be stationary for the 30-minute treatment time.

5. Daily Whitening with Tartar Protection is another 6% hydrogen peroxide gel strip. It is used just 5-minutes/day, and has an added chemical that discourages tartar from attaching to the teeth.  It has 38 upper and lower strips in the package.  Some people form tartar very easily, especially on the backs of the lower teeth, and this product inhibits the tartar from attaching to the teeth.

In using any of the Crest bleaching products, please follow the specified instructions that come with each product.

Crest White Strip products work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains. If you have severely stained teeth, especially those with tetracycline (an antibiotic) stain, the strips may not work well for you.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated in-office form of bleaching (called ""power bleaching"").

3.0,A2V1J3JT5OOZFO,B000PKKAFK,"I have used Norelco shavers for many years and prefer them to all other models I have tried. This review comes from much experience with the brand.

This Arcitec design looks fancy and works well, but gets three average stars because it really works no better than the previous non-space-age, less expensive designs. The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don't waste money on the Cleaner accessory. It is fairly comfortable to hold (I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job. It requires cleaning after each use as there is no space for the hairs. I have always cleaned my shavers after each use anyway. Unless you just want the apperance, it is not worth the extra money.

Technically: The triple-blade per round head (each cutter has three spinning blade areas) does not do any better than a double cutting blade. Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit in the 70's, Jim Belushi said, ""Buy a triple bladed razor. For those that will believe anything"". Lift-and-cut is a ridiculous concept and a marketing ploy, but Norelco's do a nice job. Norelco went back to more diagonal openings with this model, which is good. Many other newer models have lots of little pin-holes which are worthless, as the hairs have no time to enter a small hole with shaving motion. You would have to set it directly on a hair to cut it. The less pin-holes the better.

Feel: The head design feels better on the neck, and has not caused razor-burn if I do not stretch the skin tight like I need to with the original model. It takes the same time to shave as my older unit, and I get no better results, no faster. It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.

Function: It is a little bit easier to shave under the nose, above my mustache, but not a major difference. It is much harder to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped. Very poorly designed trimmer, so I use my older shaver for that.

Battery: Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices. But, it states to not over-charge. Meaning, you need to be around when recharging to unplug it after it is charged; not good for those that shave and must go to work. The other units would shut off after charging.

Cleaner/Charger: Again, one needs to be around when it is finished to not over-charge. The cleaner is not necessary and a waste of time, money, and chemicals. I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket (one can't blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can't be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).

Overall: Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns. Nicer on the neck.

4.0,A3FKGKUCI3DG9U,B000PKKAFK,"The Shave:
This is a lower-cost version of the Norelco 1090.  The major diffference is the display. The floating heads on the Norelco electric shaver really do a good job of conforming to the curves of my face. It takes me about five minutes to shave. The shave is much more uniform than that of the Braun 3615 that I have been using for the past few years. However, the shave is not as close. Before the Braun, I used a Norelco 5801. This model is a big improvement over the old Norelco which was slow and not very close at all. The trade-off with respect to the Braun is one of a closer shave using the Braun vs. a more uniform shave with the new Norelco.

Maintenance:
The clippings are collected in pockets under the shaving heads, This is an advantage in that the clippings are not scattered over the bathroom sink as they are with some electric razors. The pockets have to be cleaned out every shave or two. This is not a big problem. It only takes a few seconds. The manual indicates that the RQ10 shaving head assembly must be replaced every year. Amazon offers the RQ10 for $35. By contrast the Braun cutter and foil assembly which lasts for about one year sells on Amazon for around $24.

PS: I found that I had to replace the head assembly after 6 months. I am now using a Remington Flex 360 Rotary Shaver which has a design similiar to the Norelco but provides a faster, closer shave, and costs a lot less.",Very High Tech,Philips Norelco arcitec 1060 Men's Shaving System

I was drawn in by the sleek modern looks of this razor. I'm always used Philips Norelco rotaries in the past and have been very happy with them. My last razor was a&nbsp;Philips Norelco SpeedXL&nbsp;and I'd still be using it today if I had not worn out 2 of the blades after 4 years of heavy use. In fact, I keep it around to help get the stray hairs the Arcitec misses.

If your stubble is medium to heavy thickness, then this razor will annoy the heck out of you. What used to take me about 2 minutes now takes more than 5. It just doesn't want to cut ...and if you have more than 2 days' growth, you are really in for a problem. It takes multiple passes with me stretching my skin to try to get the hairs up for this razor to get at them, and even then it misses some. It is less than 6 months old and it's as if the blades have gotten dull. But they don't pull at the hairs so that is not it. It took 2 years for my last razor's blades to dull. This one just refuses to cut well. I clean and charge it religiously, so that isn't the issue either. To top it off, the small extendable straight razor is all but useless because the main shaving head gets in the way.

This is a good looking razor that holds a charge for a long time, but that is where the pros end. I wish I could return it but I waited too long.

This enables him to get a smooth feeling on the skin without stripping and irritating it, and no creams and products are needed. The 3 rotating heads really adjust to the contour of the face and they snap open for easy clean up with water. I've seen him use it and it's a cinch, fast, easy and no mess!

It takes the same time to shave as my older unit, and I get no better results, no faster. It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.

Function: It is a little bit easier to shave under the nose, above my mustache, but not a major difference. It is much harder to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped. Very poorly designed trimmer, so I use my older shaver for that.

Battery: Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices. But, it states to not over-charge. Meaning, you need to be around when recharging to unplug it after it is charged; not good for those that shave and must go to work. The other units would shut off after charging.

Cleaner/Charger: Again, one needs to be around when it is finished to not over-charge. The cleaner is not necessary and a waste of time, money, and chemicals. I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket (one can't blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can't be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).

Overall: Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns. Nicer on the neck.

I would return it, BUT, it was a gift, AND I like the look of it. I know, I know!!

I purchased a Braun 9595 through J&R on Amazon, and it has a 60 day trial return guarantee.  This is the first micro-screen razor I have used and it is better in all respects to the Norelco Arcitec except for the fancy styling.  It is fast and comfortable, and my face feels razor smooth.  I was able to return the Arcitec and am really happy with this Braun 9595 model.",Just OK,Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men's Shaving System
3.0,A1LHAXBM5GBJS2,B000PKKAGO,"Aside from a couple years in college I haven't used an electric razor until I got this one.  After using the razor for three weeks to get used to it, it is still a bit of a let down.  It does very well cutting the hair along the cheeks but doesn't to very well along the chin and neck and found myself going over these areas over and over again to get the desired shave even breaking out my conventional razor occationaly to get a few pesky hairs that just wouldn't cut.

There are plenty of pros about this razor.  The trimmer does a decent job evening out the sideburns.  The razor tells you how much time the battery has left so you should never run out of juice in the middle of shave and it is easy to charge either on the stand or in the carring case the razor comes with.  The razor is really easy to clean.  And there is little to no irritation after the shave aside from a couple minutes of numbness right after the shave, but it's nothing a splash of water won't cure.

But if you want a close shave, a conventional razor is better but when I don't have time to break out the shaving cream, this razor will definately be suffciant.",After Three Weeks of Use,Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men's Shaving System
4.0,A3FKGKUCI3DG9U,B000PKKAGO,"The Shave:
The floating heads on the Norelco 1090 electric shaver really do a good job of conforming to the curves of my face. It takes me about five minutes to shave according to the built in timer on the handle. The shave is much more uniform than that of the Braun 3615 that I have been using for the past few years. However, the shave is not as close. Before the Braun, I used a Norelco 5801. This model is a big improvement over the old Norelco which was slow and not very close at all.. The trade-off with respect to the Braun is one of a closer shave using the Braun vs. a more uniform shave with the new Norelco.

Maintenance:
The clippings are collected in pockets under the shaving heads, This is an advantage in that the clippings are not scattered over the bathroom sink as they are with some electric razors. The pockets have to be cleaned out every shave or two. This is not a big problem. It only takes a few seconds. The manual indicates that the RQ10 shaving head assembly must be replaced every year. Amazon offers the RQ10 for $35. By contrast the Braun cutter and foil assembly which lasts for about one year sells on Amazon for around $24.

Environment:
The first thing that you notice about the Norelco razor is the packaging. The outside layer is a cardboard box that is laminated with metal foil and plastic. There is no way that this can be recycled. Inside the laminated cardboard box is a PET clear plastic enclosure. This enclosure has an outside layer and an internal division. It is thinner than most of this type of packaging so you can cut it open. The PET plastic is type 1 and may be recycled. I think that Philips could come up with a packaging scheme that is more efficient. On the other hand, having a battery minutes-remaining indicator in the razor means that you do not have to keep it plugged in all the time, so that it may drain less electricity than other rechargeable appliances do.",High Tech,Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men's Shaving System
2.0,A2W9I628I6SE1U,B000PKNPES,"I really like the look of this shaver and I was hoping it would be as good as the commercials touted it to be. Alas, this was not the case. Sure, it gives a close shave, but I have to go over and over and over the same spot to get it. And there are still hairs on my neck that it just can't cut. I've had the 1050 for about 3 months now. Just over 3 years before I was given a&nbsp;Norelco SpeedXL&nbsp;and loved it. It cut quickly and did a good job. Unfortunately it wore out and the only one of the blades still cuts. So I got this new razor hoping that it would be even better than the XL. It does contour to the face really well, but it just doesn't cut my stubble easily. More than a day or two and it has a VERY hard time. And forget the tiny trimmer, it is just too hard to use. I go back to the one on the XL if I want to trim my sideburns or nose hairs. The 1050 holds a charge for a while and does clean fairly easily but you have to do it after every one or two shaves or it gets harder to get a good shave.

I like rotary shavers and have used them most of my adult life, but this one is a let-down, especially for the $130+ price. I would seriously consider trying a Phillips or Braun foil razor the next time around, given the reviews I've read. On a final note, the stand is a bit flimsy and tips easily, and the plug is a bit large, but those are minor considerations. If you want a good, close shave that doesn't irritate, I wouldn't make this the first on your list.

UPDATE: This razor has gone from bad to worse. It sometimes takes up to 10 minutes to finish a shave. The blades aren't dull since there is no pulling, but it just doesn't want to cut. I clean and maintain it meticulously so that is not the issue. This is a good looking razor, but that is about it. I cannot recommend it to anyone at this point. I just dropped a star from my previous 3 and still feel like I'm being generous.",Not What I Hoped (and getting worse),Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men's Shaver
3.0,A2V1J3JT5OOZFO,B000PKNPES,"I have used Norelco shavers for many years and prefer them to all other models I have tried.  This review comes from much experience with the brand.

This Arcitec design looks fancy and works well, but gets three average stars because it really works no better than the previous non-space-age, less expensive designs.  The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don't waste money on the Cleaner accessory.  It is fairly comfortable to hold (I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job.  It requires cleaning after each use as there is no space for the hairs.  I have always cleaned my shavers after each use anyway.  Unless you just want the apperance, it is not worth the extra money.

Technically:  The triple-blade per round head (each cutter has three spinning blade areas) does not do any better than a double cutting blade.  Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit in the 70's, Jim Belushi said,  ""Buy a triple bladed razor.  For those that will believe anything"".  Lift-and-cut is a ridiculous concept and a marketing ploy, but Norelco's do a nice job.  Norelco went back to more diagonal openings with this model, which is good.  Many other newer models have lots of little pin-holes which are worthless, as the hairs have no time to enter a small hole with shaving motion.  You would have to set it directly on a hair to cut it.  The less pin-holes the better.

Feel:  The head design feels better on the neck, and has not caused razor-burn if I do not stretch the skin tight like I need to with the original model.  It takes the same time to shave as my older unit, and I get no better results, no faster.  It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.

5.0,A19FRW264WZTGP,B000Q9AKVE,"I am writing this on behalf my wife.  This is her first electric shaver.  I own two Panasonic men's wet/dry shavers and I love them.  She bought this because she is a recessionista - it's expensive over time with disposable shavers.

The good: It's cordelss, recharchable, easy to clean, pivots, it's curved, it works well wet or dry, awesome with shave gel and it works well for the underarms and legs.  Obviously if you want silky smooth, a blade or wax will be much better.  The pop-up trimmer is great for stray hairs, or if you have a few days of growth.

What's so-so - using it to get silky smooth down under. If you don't like hair there, it's great for keeping the hedges in check.  If you like the bald look, it will get you there.  However, it will take time to go completely smooth versus using a razor. She says it's great for touch ups between blade shaves or waxes. For instance, she used it a lot during her pregnancy. In her case the results were better than expected, but she hopes that this will improve over time. It's probably a really good solution when you are traveling and are going to be wearing a bathing suit almost everyday - especially at the beach.  The salt water may not irritate the area that much.

What's bad: The bikini attachment is useless.  My wife didn't bother trying the attachment.  If you are looking to be smooth down under, you are better off using a trimmer (Panasonic makes one for women or Wahl for men) to cut things down to an easy length for shaving or preparation for waxing.  If you are looking to trim down there, again use a cordless trimmer.

Bottom line, it is a great shaver than cuts down on wasted money and waste with disposable razors.  Just remember it takes time for your skin to get used to an electric shaver.",Great electric shaver,Panasonic Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver

5.0,AY8XPOPF0OVO5,B000URXP6E,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,Awesome product for frizzy hair,Bonne Bell Smackers Bath and Body Starburst Collection

Curl-ease takes out  the perfect amount of moisture and leaves in what my hair needs.  I have tired the Deva Towel and other microfiber towels as well as tee shirts and my hair is left with halo frizz as the micro fiber takes out too much water and the tee shirt is hit or miss.  With the  Curl-ease it is so simply, after putting in leave in conditioner and my styler on wet wet hair and giving my curls a shake I wrap my hair with the curl ease and leave on for 10 to15 minutes. After I am dressed I take it off, give my curls a shake and viola perfect curls every time with NO halo frizz!  I can choose to diffuse if I want but I always air dry as my hair is just damp.  This towel takes the drips away without removing to much water.  I love it better than tee shirts which work Ok but sometime can give my hair a little frizz and are restricting due to having the hole at the top.

I've used this brush nearly every day for at least 5 years now and the only reason I can tell its not brand-new is because the words ""Elizabeth Arden"" have worn off. I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

5.0,A31N0XY2UTB25C,B000URXP6E,"The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older. This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it).

I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress Conditioner&nbsp;for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible.

I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress&nbsp;conditioner and&nbsp;Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo&nbsp;(which had a scent I didn't like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  I replaced the shampoo with&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner.

I've tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me.

With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It's not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me.

Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I'm slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance.

The bottom line is using&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.

I'll update the review with observations about the ""strengthening"" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer.

First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner.

Update: Jan 9 2014
Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I'm now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.

What I'm using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it's like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.

Update: Feb 15 2015

I think I'm using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result.

Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.",Exceeded my Expectations - shiny and manageable,Bonne Bell Smackers Bath and Body Starburst Collection

5.0,A1JZFGZEZVWQPY,B000UYCKRC,"Dawn is the best detergent for getting stuff clean. Nothing beats it for getting grime and grease of of your pots pans, dishes, and birds.
Wait a minute birds? Yes birds. Dawn is used exclusively in all animal rescues from the exon valdez to the BP spill. The International Bird Rescue Research Center refuses to use anything else in fact. The veterinarians like its gentleness and toughness on gooey oil. They use it every day and wash their own hands with Dawn and it doesn't dry them out.

Dawn is made by procter and gamble, and they have donated over 500 thousand dollars to wildlife groups from the sales of Dawn. I prefer the ultra  original to the platinum as I find the platinum is a little harsher on my hands. The ultra works great for getting dried egg off of my dishes, and put a little in a pot to soak come back and rinse it out with a light brushing.

There are greener cleaners out there as veterinarian and head of the International Bird Rescue Research Center points out, but none of the has dawns magic she says. Dawn has petroleum in it as an ingredient. Probably why it moisturizes / doesn't dry out your hands.
I would have to agree having tried the seventh day cleaners with pretty poor results.",Dawn,Commonwealth Lavare Extra Large Pineapple Bath Soap 12 Oz. by CST
5.0,A31N0XY2UTB25C,B000UYCKRC,"I've used&nbsp;Dawn Original&nbsp;for years and liked it very much. I picked up&nbsp;Dawn Platinum&nbsp;late in 2013 and after 3 months I've used less than Dawn Original and my dishes, silverware, glasses, mugs pots and pans all very clean. BUT my hands are getting dried out when I use it.

I don't use an automatic dishwasher, just the two manual ones at the end of my arms!

During the winter I like to use my&nbsp;Slow Cooker. Anyone who is a slow cooking fan knows it can be a challenge to clean the pot or crock used. Using Dawn Ultra for Soaking loosens stubborn food considerably in a couple of hours. I think it is not quite as effective as Dawn Platinum but still an effective soak.

The scent of Dawn Ultra Original Scent is not unpleasant and is mild. Platinum's scent is more mild and for me less is better.

Both Dawn Ultra and Platinum require less product than Original in my experience. Less frequent purchases save shopping time and money. Both a plus.

The biggest differences for me between Dawn Ultra and Platinum are Platinum drying out my hands  and Platinum may be better for soaking.  In the summer when I'm not soaking as much I think Dawn Ultra is the best choice. Less drying out for the hands. In winter it's much closer. Ultra is a bit better as a soak.

I think Dawn Platinum and Ultra are very close in terms of cleaning. Both are an improvement over Dawn's Original formula dish washing liquid and worth a try.

Hope this helps someone.","Cleans Dishes CLEAN, GOOD for SOAKING & Mild Scent",Commonwealth Lavare Extra Large Pineapple Bath Soap 12 Oz. by CST

5.0,A1MTGLL68VNZZB,B000V5Z4J6,"In a recent ""talk to the the doctor"" on network TV the point was made that the dirtiest item in the bathroom was the toothbrush. It is not just the oral bacteria that is of concern. Fecal bacteria was commonly found on toothbrush handles and bristles. The easiest explanation for this was inadequate hand washing by bathroom users. As a man, I have all too often witnessed other men in public restrooms dodge right past the sink on their way out.

3.0,A2W9I628I6SE1U,B000V5Z4J6,"I would have to say that this is probably a good niche product and nice gift for someone who already owns a compatible toothbrush.  It is a handy place to store the brush heads in a sanitary manner (if you believe that the UV light kills the bacteria).

That said, for $50 plus S&H is a bit much for brush storage and cleaning.
The recharging stand has worked well enough for me in the past, and I've never had any issue with bacteria on my brush heads.  Rinse thoroughly after use and tap to get the water out, that should be enough in my opinion.  As the ""biologist"" stated in his review, this seems a bit like overkill.

This is a simple to use product that probably does what it says.

5.0,ABDR6IJ93HFIO,B000WYJTZG,"This size 3/4 Helen of Troy Tangle Free Hot Air Brush is EXACTLY what I was searching for for my shorter length, baby fine hair!

1 As a hair dryer...This unit gets hot enough but not too hot. And, it drys my hair quickly.
STYLING: Just before it is fully dry, I use my hand to take the brush move in a circular motion for a fuller look. I lift the dryer up as I curl.
For a more curly look, I tuck the brush under just like it was a curling iron and leave it for about 10 to 15 seconds per curl.

2 DRY STYLING - I use this just like a curling iron, however, since I have dry hair, I place just a half dime sized to dime sized amount of VO5 and massage this into my scalp and hair BEFORE I style with this brush...this gives my hair a shiny, healthy look.
If you have oily or normal hair, just spray/spritz a tiny bit of water from a water spray bottle between shampoos to freshen/style...do this before your dry style. It only takes a very tiny amount of water for this.

3 Two levels...High and low. I use the High for brush drying and the Low for Styling.

4 I like thag there us an ON/OFF button on the plug area and also on the brush.

5 The quality of this is amazing, The brush/dryer is quiet.

6 The brush removes for easy cleaning.

7 The brush is tangle free in my hair, much better than a nylon bristled type.

1 As a hair dryer...This unit gets hot enough but not too hot. And, it drys my hair quickly.
STYLING: Just before it is fully dry, I use my hand to take the brush move in a circular motion for a fuller look. I lift the dryer up as I curl.
For a more curly look, I tuck the brush under just like it was a curling iron and leave it for about 10 to 15 seconds per curl.

I saturate them in hibiclens, rinse and then squirt a bit of hydrogen peroxide, rinse thoroughly and allow to dry completely. It's a process and really more than I want to do. That's why these glove are so great!

When you put them on and they stretch out a bit they have tons of tiny pockets/holes and they hold plenty of shower gel or even just lather when you use bar soap (my preference). I start with my face and then work my way down. Super easy and quick and when I'm done, I can just throw them in with some towels and wash. I did hang them over a towel rod to dry because they are for exfoliation and a bit rough so you wouldn't want to wash them with more delicate stuff and even not with your nice towels but it didn't look like they harmed my everyday towels at all.

I felt squeaky clean when done but not raw or anything. They might be a bit much for people with sensitive skin on their faces but they work fabulously for me. I just put on a bit of moisturizer after, let it soak in and it was super easy to put foundation on because there was no dead/dry patches on my face to have to ""fix"".

These are about the same quality as most others I've used, although I have used worse.  The price is a bit high perhaps but I am glad they are offered online.  The pair I got had strong seams, but if I have any issues with them not lasting a normal period of time, I will update the review.

The pair I received was a gorgeous aqua color.  They come nicely labeled and would look nice as part of a homemade gift basket.

These come in handy too before using fake tanning creams or lotions.  They will shorten the life of a tan though and can be used to help get rid of fake tan streaks or splotches.  They do wear out.  I don't keep mine but at most a month even if they still look ok.  I have never seen a recommended lifespan on them.

I did hang them over a towel rod to dry because they are for exfoliation and a bit rough so you wouldn't want to wash them with more delicate stuff and even not with your nice towels but it didn't look like they harmed my everyday towels at all.

I felt squeaky clean when done but not raw or anything. They might be a bit much for people with sensitive skin on their faces but they work fabulously for me.

The bottom is all brush and you can use it to remove dead skin and overgrown cuticles. Works best wet and with soap. It is easy to hold. After using, you will want to let it air dry and keep it away from water and steam when you are not using, I say this because I have had to throw more than one bristled brush away because they get mildew when you leave them in a shower.",You can't go wrong with a quality nail brush,"Urban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized"

When I wear sandals all day, my heels can get ruff and dry looking so I feel it is important to take proper care of them.  My overall impression of this buffing brush was light way and perhaps not super expensive.  I didn't feel much of a grit difference between the two sides of the brush, I wish one side was grittier than the other side.  I did feel like overall it did a nice job on my heels and pad of my foot.  I typically like to use these dry but you can also use this one wet.

4.0,A2R1HUYHXV7H18,B0010ZBORW,"These fit even my fat, large hands.  They are pretty easy for me to put on too.  It isn't that they are big though, they just really stretch out to fit.  they work great, they feel just a bit scratchy but in use they make a soap lather well and really help get the top layer of dead skin off so that when I towel off, I just get clean and don't end up with rolls of skin that should have been washed away.  It seems like at least once a week I shed skin like crazy if I don't exfoliate, so I've used gloves like this for a few years now.

These are about the same quality as most others I've used, although I have used worse.  The price is a bit high perhaps but I am glad they are offered online.  The pair I got had strong seams, but if I have any issues with them not lasting a normal period of time, I will update the review.

The pair I received was a gorgeous aqua color.  They come nicely labeled and would look nice as part of a homemade gift basket.

These come in handy too before using fake tanning creams or lotions.  They will shorten the life of a tan though and can be used to help get rid of fake tan streaks or splotches.  They do wear out.  I don't keep mine but at most a month even if they still look ok.  I have never seen a recommended lifespan on them.

I also reviewed the
Urban Spa Volcanic Pumice Stone

It is natural pumice.  In fact, mine had a couple of spots of granite? apparent where the pumice was cut from the top of some volcanic flow.  It is shaped great to fit well in the hand and works great on feet without hurting.  I would give the pumice stone a 5 star rating.  It isn't the gray crumbly pumice, it is hard, red, mineral infused pumice that is more durable.","Great for use with artificial tanning lotions and creams, help remove loose, old skin in the tub/shower and not on my towels","Urban Spa Moisturizing Booties to Keep your Feet Smooth, Hydrated and Moisturized"

Because this isn't a foaming product, you do have to use more than you would with some competing products.  I found it non-irritating, too.  (You can see the full ingredients list if you scroll down the main product page.)

I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,Awesome product for frizzy hair,Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz

After I am dressed I take it off, give my curls a shake and viola perfect curls every time with NO halo frizz!  I can choose to diffuse if I want but I always air dry as my hair is just damp.  This towel takes the drips away without removing to much water.  I love it better than tee shirts which work Ok but sometime can give my hair a little frizz and are restricting due to having the hole at the top.

I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation.

5.0,A31N0XY2UTB25C,B0012Y0ZG2,"The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older. This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it).

I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress Conditioner&nbsp;for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible.

I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress&nbsp;conditioner and&nbsp;Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo&nbsp;(which had a scent I didn't like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  I replaced the shampoo with&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner.

I've tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me.

With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It's not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me.

Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I'm slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance.

The bottom line is using&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.

I'll update the review with observations about the ""strengthening"" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer.

First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner.

Update: Jan 9 2014
Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I'm now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.

What I'm using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it's like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.

Update: Feb 15 2015

I think I'm using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result.

Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.",Exceeded my Expectations - shiny and manageable,Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz

- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,Awesome product for frizzy hair,Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz

With the  Curl-ease it is so simply, after putting in leave in conditioner and my styler on wet wet hair and giving my curls a shake I wrap my hair with the curl ease and leave on for 10 to15 minutes. After I am dressed I take it off, give my curls a shake and viola perfect curls every time with NO halo frizz!  I can choose to diffuse if I want but I always air dry as my hair is just damp.  This towel takes the drips away without removing to much water.  I love it better than tee shirts which work Ok but sometime can give my hair a little frizz and are restricting due to having the hole at the top.

I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation.

5.0,A31N0XY2UTB25C,B0012Y0ZG2,"The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older. This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it).

I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress Conditioner&nbsp;for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible.

I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula&nbsp;Nexxus Humectress&nbsp;conditioner and&nbsp;Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo&nbsp;(which had a scent I didn't like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  I replaced the shampoo with&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner.

I've tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me.

With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It's not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me.

Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I'm slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance.

The bottom line is using&nbsp;Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo&nbsp;and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.

I'll update the review with observations about the ""strengthening"" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer.

First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner.

Update: Jan 9 2014
Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I'm now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.

What I'm using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it's like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.

Update: Feb 15 2015

I think I'm using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result.

Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now.",Exceeded my Expectations - shiny and manageable,Bath &amp; Body Works Ile De Tahiti Moana Coconut Vanille Moana Body Wash with Tamanoi 8.5 oz

- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor.

3.0,A35W3JQYP0M655,B0013NB7DW,"I recently started using an electric razor after years of being a supporter of the wet shave market.  Mostly for times when it's convenient and I am in a hurry.  I remember years ago when I used an electric shaver that this Williams lectric shave worked well in making a difference in a close shave.  Picking up a bottle after all these years proves that it still does, and in my opinion a pre shave lotion is a good investment for electric razor users.  That being said, I have to say that somewhere along the line Williams changed their formula somewhat, at least in the scent, for its not the same as I remember to be sure.  Years ago this pre shave smelled as nice as any after shave did.  It was a pleasant but not too strong barber shop sort of spice scent. Now it seems to have a very weak but not at all likable scent that despite its lack of strength still seems to linger on after you shave, even with a rinse.  It reminds me very much of those cheap after shave rip offs you can find in some dollar stores that go on smelling nice for a few minutes, but then quickly turn sour and cheap...  As good as this works at stimulating your beard with a splash of alcohol and other ingredients, my recommendation is to use Afta brand pre shave which I picked up at a local pharmacy, but is also readily available here on Amazon in a two pack at the time of this writing.  In fact I have ordered some here simply because Afta's availability locally is spotty at best.  Williams seems to have a marketing hold in my neck of the woods because its also easy to find.  But I still recommend this only if you don't have any Afta available.  Afta smells much better, works as well if not better than the Willians, and unlike the Williams, to my knowledge has always been the same formula....&nbsp;Mennen Afta Pre-Electric original 3 FL OZ (PACK OF 2)",Works Well......Sour Scent....Afta Is Better,"Williams Lectric Shave, 7 Ounce"

3.0,A35W3JQYP0M655,B0013NB7DW,"I recently started using an electric razor after years of being a supporter of the wet shave market.  Mostly for times when it's convenient and I am in a hurry.  I remember years ago when I used an electric shaver that this Williams lectric shave worked well in making a difference in a close shave.  Picking up a bottle after all these years proves that it still does, and in my opinion a pre shave lotion is a good investment for electric razor users.  That being said, I have to say that somewhere along the line Williams changed their formula somewhat, at least in the scent, for its not the same as I remember to be sure.  Years ago this pre shave smelled as nice as any after shave did.  It was a pleasant but not too strong barber shop sort of spice scent. Now it seems to have a very weak but not at all likable scent that despite its lack of strength still seems to linger on after you shave, even with a rinse.  It reminds me very much of those cheap after shave rip offs you can find in some dollar stores that go on smelling nice for a few minutes, but then quickly turn sour and cheap...  As good as this works at stimulating your beard with a splash of alcohol and other ingredients, my recommendation is to use Afta brand pre shave which I picked up at a local pharmacy, but is also readily available here on Amazon in a two pack at the time of this writing.  In fact I have ordered some here simply because Afta's availability locally is spotty at best.  Williams seems to have a marketing hold in my neck of the woods because its also easy to find.  But I still recommend this only if you don't have any Afta available.  Afta smells much better, works as well if not better than the Willians, and unlike the Williams, to my knowledge has always been the same formula....&nbsp;Mennen Afta Pre-Electric original 3 FL OZ (PACK OF 2)",Works Well......Sour Scent....Afta Is Better,"Williams Lectric Shave, 7 Ounce"

The Truth Serum is my favorite of the three products. My face seems smoother and feels smooth and fresh after using it. I use it morning and night after cleansing my face. Moisturizer Creme seems to slide on over this serum. The Transformation Cream is OK, but I have another I prefer. The Invigorating Night Gel is exactly that, you can feel your skin tingle after application. I have not noted any real difference using this gel, but it has a nice feel. It feels sticky at first,but then fades away to smooth.

This kind if mini kit is a perfect method to try new products, and to decide what may work for you. I will certainly purchase the Truth Serum again.

I really loved it, the wash is silky smooth and lathers into plenty of cleansing bubbles without stripping moisture away...I think people who are used to soap and the tight extra clean feeling they get, find a moisturizing body wash strange, but sapping all moisture from the skin with soap is not good, if you don't moisturize afterwards all that water is escaping and creating wrinkles and discomfort.

4.0,A19FRW264WZTGP,B001AJ6YS2,"Since high school, I have owned corded and cordless shavers from almost all the major brands.  In my humble opinion, the Norelco and Panasonic are the two best.  It comes down to whether you like a foil or a rotary head style.

Personally,I found this as great rotary dollar for dollar. I had a clipless coupon here on Amazon and there was an amazing price before the coupon.  The shaver was less than $20. On price alone, it's a 5 star deal.

But price isn't everything.  I like the durability, and Philips uses cheaper plastic than my shavers from the late 1990's  early 2000's .  The charging cord is also flimsy.

They do score major points with the ability to rinse the heads under water.

3.0,A2DG9F8YOXNY7Y,B001AJ8YGC,"I've been using these Norelco shavers for years.  They last 3-5 years and then I get a new one; method of death typically involves worn out battery or getting smashed in a fall to the floor.  This is the latest one that I bought a couple weeks ago, and I've been the least satisfied with it so far.

First, it lacks a ""needs charge"" indicator.  While it appears to have two LEDs on the front, which I took to mean one LED for ""charging/charged"", and one for ""needs/low charge"", it's really just one indicator made to look like two.  An unfortunate related problem:  Norelco describes the ""needs charge"" or ""low charge"" indication simply as a ""charge indicator""; hey Norelco, that's insufficient English, because it could be taken to mean ""chargING indicator"".  When I was looking at buying one of these, I didn't realize that ""charge indicator"" in the description meant what it actually means.

Second, Norelco's descriptions of their shavers no longer tell you what kind of battery is inside.  Is it NiCd or NiMH?  Which one matters because you can run a NiCd battery all the way down without problems, but if you do so to a NiMH you are actually damaging it.  Repeated deep discharges of NiMH will kill it.  For that reason I actually prefer the older NiCd batteries because I can run them all the way down, and don't care about the quicker charge feature of NiMH batteries.  The only indication that it's probably a NiCd is that the manual says ""battery performance is best if you recharge only when the batteries are (almost) completely empty.""  Here's hoping.

All that said, I may very well keep this shaver.  I'm on the fence and trying to give it a chance.","no low-charge indication, unknown battery type",Philips Norelco 7340 Men's Shaving System packaging may vary
5.0,A3OC93X866Z8TB,B001AMMSNE,"I have been looking for a curling product that would keep the curl in my hair, but not cause my hair to be crunchy or frizzy.  Well, I have finally found it!  This is now one of my ""must have"" products, along with several others that I never deviate from.

Gels leave my hair crunchy, and so do most mousses.  Not only that, but they make the curls clump together which makes my very fine hair look horribly thin and wet.  Then, if I try to fluff it or brush it out, my hair becomes frizzy and it loses the curl.

Alterna Texturing Glaze makes my hair soft, not crunchy, and it leaves it full.  It is so hard to explain, because I didn't believe it based on what the other reviews were saying.  But I got a gift certificate that I was able to use so I thought I would give it a try.  I have wavy, fine, thin hair, and this stuff just keeps the wave in it while taking away any frizz.  It almost looks like I have a nice perm that I don't have to use styling products to enhance it (if that makes sense).  When I touch my hair, it feels like I don't have any product in it.

5.0,A2UHXPMDDHRFC9,B001AMRQ2W,"A great razor without a lot of bells and whistles. Why pay 2 or 3 times more for, basically, the same razor with a few more lights? I agree that a low battery light would have been nice, but this isn't a big deal since the battery lasts a long time and can be charged in 1 hour. Plus, if you don't have an hour to wait around a quick 5 minute charge will get the job done (or you can use it corded.)

Now, as far as the shave goes it gives a very close shave with no irritation. It is a little faster than previous models but don't expect to cut your shaving time in half. I tried a foil razor once and it left a few stray hairs here and there which it refused to pick up no matter how hard I tried to get them. I switched to a rotary and I haven't had that problem since. I switched to electric razors a few years ago when my face just couldn't handle blades anymore; I thought I'd have to sacrifice the closeness of a blade for a healthier face but this hasn't been the case with Norelco, they have consistently given me blade close shaves.

I've had this razor for about 6 months now and couldn't be happier. I've read the reviews on the Arcitec and, honestly, can't see a good reason why I should pay 2 or 3 times for it when this one works so wonderfully.",Nice close shave,Philips Norelco Speed-XL 8240 Men's Shaving System
5.0,A2BVRKJ12P1HDY,B001AMRQ2W,"I bought the 8240XL for my Dad for Fathers Day and he loves it!!! It gives him a close comfortable shave.  I own the 8260XL and the reason I did not get him that model is because I knew he would not use the Jet Clean System.  This razor is very good for my Dad, but as for me it's a different story!  I collect Norelco Electric Razors.  I have the Spectra James Bond Razor, the Smart Touch XL with the minute display, and the Arcitec 1050cc with the Jet Clean System, and the 8260XL with the Jet Clean System.  Now which one shaves the best?  First, unlike my Dad, I have a heavy dark beard and I have to shave every morning and sometimes in the afternoon to keep from getting a shadow.  For me, all of these razors shave ok, just ok, never as close as a blade!, but the best of these razors are the Spectra James Bond Razor and the Smart Touch XL.  These two razors shave pretty close.  The 8200 series is ok, and I will leave it at that.  The razors in the 8200 series  are all pretty much the same except as you move up the line you get more bells and whistles. All the razors in the 8200 series shave the same.  I shave with the Arcitec 1050cc and the 8260XL and rotate between the two. At present, they are doing a pretty good job, but sometimes I  bring my other razors out of retirement.  I like to use Mennen Afta Pre Electric Loation and a little talc powder which helps me to achieve a close comfortable shave. Williams Lectric Shave is too greasey.  After shaving, I put on a little Mennen Afta After Shave Skin Conditioner or Nivea Post Shave Balm which helps my skin from becoming dry. I do not get razor burn from any of these electric razors. I do like the Jet Clean System that came with my Arcitec 1050cc and 8260XL.  I always wash out my razors before I use them in the cleaning system which helps to save on the cleaning solution.  The cleaning solution last about a month and it can be purchased at Walmart or you can have it delivered right to your door every month by purchasing it from Amazon. Norelco has been a trad in my family for years.  My Dad, Grandfathers and Great Grandfathers all shaved with Norelco Electric Razors.  I'm 47 and I have been shaving with them for the most part since I started shaving.  I have had problems with Norelco though.  There have been times when a relatively new Norelco Razor would just quit on me, but I am happy to say that Philips Norelco ALWAYS replaced the defective razor!  If you want to get a close comfortable shave stick with Norelco.  Shaving with Norelco Electric Razors is better then the mess of soap and water and you don't have to buy blades and shaving cream all the time.-Michael",Dad's Fathers Day Gift,Philips Norelco Speed-XL 8240 Men's Shaving System
4.0,A2TO2BN3P4C00L,B001AMRQ2W,"I just received this razor as an upgrade to the Philips Norelco 7110X which I had been using for the past 19 months.  While one would expect this razor to perform better given its list price (approximately double what the 7110X is currently), I was frankly surprised by how much better it is in almost every regard.

I previously reviewed the 7110X, so if you want to see what I found lacking in that razor the review is available under that product listing.  As to the superior qualities of the 8240XL, they are:

1.  Shaves are closer and do not require as many passes over the same area.  I still don't think it gives me as good of a shave as a manual razor and shaving cream, but I've never found an electric shaver that could compete with a manual razor in terms of closeness of shave.  Sometimes I prefer the convenience of the electric shaver, however, so that's why I use both methods on occasion.

2.  Feels more solid in the hand.

3.  While it isn't quiet, it sounds less annoying when it's running.

The only serious problem I've encountered so far is with respect to charging the razor.  The manual indicates it may take 12 hours to fully charge the razor before the first use.  I had mine plugged in for over 15 hours and the light on the razor indicated that it was not yet fully charged.  I decided to keep the razor plugged in and use it.  After I completed shaving, the charging light briefly indicated it was fully charged but then started indicating it was still charging again.  I decided to unplug the razor anyway.  I re-checked the manual.  Unfortunately, it's written to cover three different models, so not everything in the manual pertains to this specific model.  Even so, the drawings indicate charging lights on the razor that simply don't correspond to what's on the actual unit (for example, I don't see anywhere on the unit that the word ""Full"" would illuminate), and there's no indication in the manual that these drawings only pertain to other units.  Strange.

Before owning my Philips Norelco 7110X, I had also owned another Norelco model (more similar in quality to this razor than the 7110X) and some other models from Braun.  I've generally been pleased with Norelco electric razors, and this one is another winner.","works well, feels nice in hand, charging function is confusing",Philips Norelco Speed-XL 8240 Men's Shaving System

It seems my face needs the combination of tree tree oil and triclosan in a facial soap in order to behave in a manageable way - meaning not break out every 2 days. Once I did the research on triclosan I was suitably cautioned as well as kind of confused: if this triclosan is so awful why is it the number one ingredient of anti microbial, antiseptic hand washes in hospitals? OK, maybe it need not be added to mouthwash and maybe it really should be kept away from small children and babies but you can't just take it away and not replace it with something as equally effective! That is what the ""Greenies"" and the ""It Causes Cancer!"" throngs have effectively done, I guess. They don't get zits, they can splash their porcelain skins with warm water, waft a towel in the general direction of their faces and be glowing and perfect.

4.0,AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B001E96LUO,"Finally seeing results.  But don't get the wrong idea.  This result-delay is probably not a CLEAN & CLEAR problem.  For some reason our teen boy thought he should use this cleanser  without a washcloth... AND apparently a washcloth is an extremely important part of getting the upper hand on breakouts.

The Backstory
Our boy is 14 and is having to begin shaving several times a week. (Somehow it doesn't seem right that our baby is shaving. sigh.)  This shaving is aggravating his breakouts taking them up a level.  We got this Clean & Clear Cleanser to see what results we could get with an over the counter product.  After a week and a half there wasn't (initially) enough improvement so we made an appointment with a dermatologist.

We've since CANCELLED that appointment because I happened to watch boy wash his face one night. No Wash Cloth.  I smacked my forehead and took the time to show him how to properly wash his face.  Apparently this is a thing guys don't all know.  It's been a week since the demonstration (which included a mention that you don't scrub your face fiercely. That the skin there is delicate, particularly under the eyes....)  and his face is looking really good.  I suspect in another few days even the small spots will be gone.

This is working for us.  If you've got  younger teen using it, I highly recommend making sure that they know what they should be doing.  Don't assume they read the directions, even if they read everything else that crosses their path.

Zum Oil - use for massage or I used all over after I got out of the shower before bed. It is oil but I didn't feel greasy. I like it better than baby oil that I've used sometimes in the past.

Zum Mist - Use this on yourself or spray your bed linens with it. So relaxing. The scent is somewhat subtle - that's not to say you can hardly smell it. It smells strong enough but not so strong that it's overwhelming like some mists I've used.

Zum Wash - I thought it lathered well and it didn't strip my skin.

Zum Body - It's lotion and you get 2 plump pillow packages of it. There's enough in each pack to do your hands, feet, elbows and knees. Love it!

Zum Bar - you get two fairly good sized bars. I imagine they'll last at least a few months depending on how often you use them. I really like this soap. I wash my hands a lot and this soap doesn't feel like it'll make my hands too dry and you can't feel a coating when you rinse. It feels like your hands are clean but they have a lovely scent to them that lasts for awhile. Note that right after washing my hands I was eating some cherries and though I could smell the scent a little, I couldn't taste it at all so even though it does scent your hands a bit, it's not so much that you'll end up transferring the scent/taste to food you might handle after. Just make sure you rinse well.

Zum Rub - I thought the scent of this was a little less than the other products but the balm really softened the heels of my feet. I use it along with a pair of heel socks and I wake up in the morning with soft heels and no cracks. Plus it comes in this adorable little tin that you could re-use after the Zum rub is gone.

5.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B001F51RAG,"I was finally convinced to start flossing regularly when a dentist told me I was showing the early signs of gingivitis.  That probably happened something like 15 years ago.  This is not the cheapest floss out there, but it really is the only one I can stand to use.  I just hate the waxy feeling of standard dental floss, but Glide is so much smoother.  (I am reminded of this every now and then when I run out of Glide and have to use free floss samples from the dentist until I can run to the store to restock.)

I started using Glide floss when I got braces (had them from age 25-28!).  I got tired of shredding floss on all the little wires, brackets, etc., and then trying to have to get it unstuck.  Glide wasn't 100% shred proof, but it outperformed any other floss I tried, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with dental work to maneuver around (I had a wire glued to the back of my bottom teeth after my braces were removed, so I am stuck with a minor amount of dental work for life).

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't even notice the change from original Glide (GoreTex) to the current product.  Well, I noticed the package was different, I suppose, but I felt like the product was still quite good.  I find it to be quite strong and not easily breakable (have even used it to sew up holes in dog toys).",favorite floss,"Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Dental Floss, Original Floss, 50m, Pack of 6"
5.0,A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,B001F51RAG,"I've always had a problem with flossing since it's so difficult to work the floss between some of my teeth. I tried this on a recommendation from my dentist and it's made a world of difference. This floss is more like a tape than conventional floss, and just slips through the tightest spots without any difficulty. It's also very comfortable on the gum line, and rarely breaks in use. I can't say it makes flossing fun, but it certainly makes it much easier.

If you're a Sam's Club member you can get this in the 6-pack for a little better price. Highly recommend for those who find regular floss too difficult to use.",Ideal for tightly spaced teeth,"Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Dental Floss, Original Floss, 50m, Pack of 6"
5.0,A2D1LPEUCTNT8X,B001F51RAG,"I look for a few simple things in my floss

1) I don't want it to shred
2) I don't want it to be stuck between my teeth
3) I want it to do the cleaning
4) I don't want the flavoring on the floss to be too noticeable

I have tried a number of different floss, and keep coming back to Glide Floss simply because it works the best.  It feels good on my teeth and my fingers holding the floss. It never breaks when I use it.  It never shreds, it glides easily between my (tightly packed) teeth. You can do the cleaning in one pass, it digs out whatever happen to be stuck in there very well. With other floss I feel I need to make a second pass sometimes, but not with Glide.

Flavor: Glide comes in two packaging. Photo attached. One has silver packaging and one has greenish packaging. The silver packaging has no mint flavor, the greenish package has mint flavor (not terribly strong but noticeable). The describe of the package for silver package mentioned ""deep protection"" and for green package mentions ""multi-protection"". I don't feel or see the difference between the two other than one has flavor and the other one does not. I did not notice the mint flavor mentioned on the package. I have a slight preference for no flavor, so if I knew I would have picked the silver package.

In term of price Glide is a little pricier than other floss. To me it is worth it. The best price on this 6 packs I found at Costco, especially when they run a coupon in their flyer. Amazon price is is decent, but fluctuates. I found a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate alert emails when the price reaches the desired price. If you enter ""price history alert"" in Google it will be come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool to be very helpful.

Coincidence or not? I noticed that when I use my Glide floss my hygienist compliments me on my flossing!

Very happy about this as I have very fussy gums (sensitive) and they have responded well to my using this toothbrush. Below I will share how I use this toothbrush on my very finicky gums...

How I brush with this toothbrush: I brush (twice a day or more) for 2 to 3 minutes, however, I do not press down too hard with this toothbrush, press down too hard on the gums can cause irritation I found. What I find is the most helpful is brushing at moderate pressure for 2 to 3 minutes. Then I use a antiseptic rinse and my teeth, mouth and gums are good to go for hours.
Also I brush at night before bedtime (and sometimes after lunch), so this toothbrush gets a great workout. Even brushing as often (and long) as I do, I have no problems with this toothbrush  and it is great quality and I believe it will last longer than the cheap generic types of toothbrushes do.

5.0,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B001LNODUS,"Note: At the time of this review, seven different products are being sold on the same page. I am reviewing the lavendar lavender blossoms.

This is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

When you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

If there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it.",good natural scent,Pre de Provence Maison French Dried Lavender Blossoms for Fragrance

What I've found is that lavender scents can be tricky. Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent.

I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much.

The Pre De Provence lavender spray smells fabulous. Not the least bit musty, which some lavender sprays can get a bit of a musty undertone, not this one. It's fresh and clean and brightens the entire room. I iron clothes inside out if I'm going to use any spray, and a light spritz left a wonderful fragrance, not overwhelming, and didn't stain my clothes. I would suggest trying a small out of the way place first.

Lavender salts are fragrant salts that you pour into your bathwater when the bathtub is filling with water.  They relax you, and help to ease tensions with their floral fragrances.

These bath salts are quite potent.  A little bit goes a long way, as the scent is pungent.

Pamper yourself after a long day by adding these to your bath.  Relax and inhale the beautiful fragrance of lavender.

These also work well when incorporated into sachets.

Carry it in your sundries (with glue, maybe in a little box or bag) in case of disaster. You'll need a small pair of scissors, too. If you have a nail disaster before a performance, this may save you.

You might also be able to make reinforced tips for your nails if you tend to break. I'm usually good unless it's winter or unless I'm doing household chores and forget ""GLOVES!"" Then my middle nail and my thumbnail tend to be the ones at risk for breakage.

It had served me well for literally years, but you're really not supposed to keep makeup for years.  I went looking for the same item as a replacement and couldn't find it, so I just bought another Cover Girl concealer stick.

This is basically the same product I loved so much before.  Whether it's identical, or whether all Cover Girl concealer sticks are similar, I can't say.  What I do know is that it works very well for me.  I mostly use it to cover up breakouts and it is really good at minimizing redness while blending in to my foundation (I use a Neutrogena liquid foundation).  This shade (fair, 705) is actually a reasonable match for my skin tone, so sometimes I use this with no foundation.  I can put finishing powder over this and my concealer and you can hardly tell the difference between where the concealer is and the rest of my skin.

This does not irritate my skin and it lasts all day (with foundation).  I rarely rave over drugstore brand cosmetics, but this is one product that really works for me.  It's my ""go to"" heavy-duty concealer.

I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.

I've used this brush nearly every day for at least 5 years now and the only reason I can tell its not brand-new is because the words ""Elizabeth Arden"" have worn off. I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

5.0,A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,B002B4VBV0,"I've used pretty much every Norelco out there from the top of the line SensoTouch 3D to their bottom of the line 6000 series. For my face, the HQ9 heads on the 8000 series continue to be the best the Norelco has ever produced. The extra row of rings really makes a difference compared with the HQ8 (and lower) heads on the lower models, which have only one ring of slots and holes. The shave is faster, closer and more gentle. I also find them to be preferable to the HQ10 heads on the Arcitec line (which I believe is no longer produced).

To get as good a shave (and a bit of a better shave on the neck and jaw line) you have to go to the RQ12 heads for the SensoTouch 3D. The HQ9 heads are a far better value -- you get 90% of the performance of the RQ12 heads at less than a third of the cost. Oftentimes the price of an entire 8000-series razor with HQ9 heads is less than the cost of just the replacement heads for a SensoTouch 3D.

What you give up with this razor is some build quality. Although these are made in The Netherlands (and not China as are other mid- and lower-end Norelco models) the build quality is still not as good as their higher end models. This is especially seen in the way the combs and cutters are held into place - it's just a thin plastic retainer system rather than a sturdy combination of metal and plastic in the 3D. You'll want to be careful when taking the heads out for cleaning so as not to break the retaining clip.

Other than the head retaining clip, the build quality is decent. Easy to grip even with wet hands. The built-in trimmer is somewhat poor, but it's hard to find a good trimmer on any electric razor. It comes with a stand, but it's only for storage and not charging -- you have to take it out of the stand to charge it.

The other thing you give up with this model is the ability to shave wet. For me that's not a big deal, since I use an electric to save time, and wet shaving takes twice as long as a dry shave. In the summer months when it's humid I'll use some Face Saver (Remington) which makes a dry shave just as comfortable as a wet shave. Should you prefer a wet shave and want to stay with a rotary, take a look at the Norelco AT830. It has RQ8 heads so the dry shave is not as good as this model, but the wet shave is very nice. I'd recommend pretty much any Panasonic if you're looking for a wet shave in a foil shaver.

While you can't wet shave with this, you can clean it under running water. I only take the heads out for a more detailed cleaning about once a month. Otherwise, just pop the top open, run hot water through it, and you're good to go.

Quiet, comfortable, fast, close and cheap. Can't ask for more from a razor. Highly recommend.",A great mid-level razor,Philips Norelco Speed Electric Razor

If you've never tried it, you won't believe how great it makes your skin feel and look, and this brush is a wonderful tool to start with.
First of all there are slight curves on the handle. This means that whether you grip the brush at the top or closer to the bottom it will be comfortable and not slip around. The bristles look to be natural, and have just the right amount of stiffness for exfoliation. Simply rub on your skin gently so that all of the dead skin flakes off.
Next, I like to get in the shower and use the brush while it's wet to both cleanse and to use the bumpy side to massage my legs and rear.

Both sudz up nicely with body wash and should work well with salt or sugar scrubs as well. It is easy to slip on and has a handy loop for hanging and drying in the shower.

The natural bamboo and jute mitt is a little small on my hand (6ft tall man) but it works. It should be fine on smaller hands. I'm a hairy guy and some of my body hair does attach itself to the mitt even after thoroughly rinsing and wringing out. That doesn't bother me, but it might limit shareablity with my wife. I also worry that over time it might get a musty smell since it takes a while to dry, but as long as I keep using it with soap, I hope that it won't be an issue.

3.0,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B002GP80EU,"Obviously, cellulite is not affected by a brush. Simple biology reveals the massive flaws in this idea. If what one is truly seeking is to improve cellulite, one wants a cellulite creme with caffeine OR with any form of retinoid. Or a plastic surgeon. This whole topic was just explored on an episode of The Doctors.

However, let's talk about what this brush is great for: exfoliating! One can do a light dry rub before a shower or a lighter rub during the shower (be careful, wet skin is more delicate). This will keep skin youthful if one follows up with a light moisturizer.

The brush is well-made, looks nice, and has held up well this week (it appears brand new even though it is hanging in my shower).

5.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B002RZZXYE,"I got this in a beauty subscription box.  I've had it for so long I forget which box.  I needed a new exfoliator so I grabbed this from my stash.

Here are the ingredients, since listing them provides a good introduction to the product:

Water, Lactic Acid, Polyethylene, Soybean Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pectin, Papaya Fruit, Lactobacillus Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Ceteareth-20, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dehydroxanthan Gum, PEG-100 Stearate, Salicylic Acid, SD Alcohol 40-B, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Sorbic Acid, Cinnamomum Cassia Leaf Oil, Honey, Acetic Acid, Lavender Oil, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bromelain, Papain, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Phenoxyethanol, Geranium Maculatum Oil, Rosewood Wood Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Orange Oil, Linalool, Limonene, Cinnamal, Beta-Carotene (CI 75130), Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex (CI 75810).

This is basically a chemical and physical exfoliator in one.  It has lactic acid, papaya fruit, pumpkin extract, bromelain (digestive enzyme from pineapple), and papain (digestive enzyme from papaya).  I have seen all of these in peels before.  These ingredients are why you leave this on the face for one or two minutes after scrubbing with this product -- to give the ""peel"" portion time to do its work.

It also has some kind of grit in it.  I'm not sure what the grit is, but it works as a physical exfoliator.

This has a couple of other things that will especially help oily or acne-prone skin: salicylic acid, honey (has antibacterial properties), and retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).  Because of all the peeling ingredients and such, you will really want to use a good SPF product while you are using this to avoid sun damage.

This may make your skin more sensitive than usual.  I am a longtime exfoliator on a daily or every other day basis, so while I do get some tingling when I use this (usually every other day since this is a bit stronger than the sorts of things I normally use), it doesn't last -- once I wash the product off, the sensation goes away.  If you have sensitive skin, you will want to be super careful.  Maybe do a patch test first.  I think the tingling might be from the cinnamon; I have definitely had reactions to cinnamon oil in the past that turned my skin red, although it seems to be at a low enough level here that it is not doing that.

This is a green color, I'm guessing from the chlorophyll/copper complex.  It has the texture of a clay mask, maybe a bit thinner (easier to spread around on the face and rub in), and I can't quite place the smell, although this does have a lot of plant oils and extracts and I guess the scent is just a combination of those.  Maybe something citrusy but there are also some floral notes in there.

I personally don't find this drying.  I think the concentration of the grit/solids/beads is just about right as I can actually feel them moving over my face (some exfoliators don't have enough exfoliating particles to be worth it, but this is not one of those).  It washes off cleanly and has not caused any irritation to my skin.  I do think I am getting good results -- existing breakouts are clearing up faster than usual (this is really the only change in my routine) and I'm not getting new ones, even though I am using facial oils.  (I can only use facial oils if I am also using a good exfoliator.)

I do use kind of a lot of this at once.  I could probably get by with less and actually need to learn to get by with less because this is a pretty expensive product.  But, it works and I am going to dig through my stash (which is huge) to see if I can find more, because I am really liking the results.","works very well, maybe not the best for sensitive skin",Kate Somerville&nbsp;ExfoliKate Intensive&nbsp;Exfoliating Treatment&nbsp;(5 Fl.

5.0,A3TWPW6C78JPGV,B002RZZXYE,"Exfolikate is a great product--sort of a cross between an exfoliating scrub and a mild superficial peel--and it gives instant results, which is more than can be said for a lot of cosmetic products.  I've used Exfolikate for several years, and it *does* live up to the hype and cult-following; you get results after even a single use.

Some people don't like Exfolikate because they think it's too aggressive;  I once heard someone say it should be used for scrubbing bathrooms!!  I think it really depends on how your skin is....and only you know that best.  For me, it works very well--my oily skin doesn't slough off easily, causing skin particles, oil, and hard water in San Francisco to combine into invisible pore-clogging scum.  Exfolikate helps---it removes dead skin to smooth my face and de-gunks my pores so they're (temporarily) less noticeable.  I use it 1-2 times per week, and leave it on for about 3-4 minutes prior to showering.  From personal experience, let me warn you: DO NOT try leaving it on longer because you think you'll get even better results.  I once left it on for 25 minutes, and really regretted it;  it took off too much surface, leaving me with raw skin which kind of dried out/peeled off after a couple of days.  Lesson learned the hard way.

My skin is hardy, so I let it stay on my skin for five minutes before I rinsed it off.

No lotion is needed after using this body polish. I use it once a week or so, and my skin still feels smooth for a few days. This is a great exfoliant. Fresh products have a superb reputation. I have visited the store in Boston many times, and the pure scents of the products are revitalizing.

It did only take two coats to apply and make streak free, acceptable looking. It also dried fast. The ultimate test will be how long it lasts under my steel-toe shoes. All other polishes--Square Hue, Opi, Avon, only last a week at the most. So far I think this is a great winter-time color though it's very flat once applied, no shiny or shimmery.

In the bottle you can see that it also has a hue of purple iridescence. However the purple doesn't really show up unless you apply a clear top coat. When you do, it turns into such a neat shade. Basically dove grey with a purple hue. A very fall-friendly shade. However Essie polish chips on me pretty quickly. Even with a top coat I can get only about a day of wear before it starts to chip. The matte finishes seem to chip the quickest, and this is one of them.

4.0,A19MMYMZO363KM,B004M0FW8Y,I've got at least 14 year old case of 150 piks that are very close to these Doctors brand I actually like much better. They are similar in size and do the same thing thin on one side and with a bit of brush to the other end. Orthodontist gave me a few of these but I like my old package better...don't know if they are still made or perhaps got sold to this maker. Anyway still they are good just not thin enough to work between my tight teeth during brace work. An older brace patient and this is scary about keeping teeth and gums healthy during the process. So these do help and for me work better than wood picks but not as well as some of the others out there. I also love the batter powered Power Flosser it's called I think. It's not a water pik but it's a little battery powered pick that fits between your teeth along the gum line...they however do not do much for the upper teeth areas which floss does better if you can figure out how to pull it off. I've got rins on back teeth molars and that prevents any flossing there so these help reach areas in the back of teeth that even the water pik does not work well and the battery flosser can't quite reach well either with the braces in my teeth. I bought these knowing in advance what they were and that they weren't quite as nice as my orginal ones but wanted the cases. I bought 6 cases for what 2 individual ones were selling for a that time on Amazon...so no choice of colors but fine. I also note if you refill from bottom hole instead of pulling off the top they last longer and less chance of breaking them too. So that's what I do. Also I could get about 4-5 more piks into the cases without having them stop up because there was too many also. I do like it when there is a case to carry these kinds of things about. So like the case and wish the picks themselves were a lot thinner on the thin end. I have very tight teeth. Also lose the teeth on the other end because all they do is grab my braces when I try to use them.

5.0,A19MMYMZO363KM,B004VGIA60,I have very tight teeth. Dental floss is difficult and dentists split dental floss and even those plastic strips they use to help form materials on a tooth from getting on the teeth next to them...those will be demolished over and over before eventually they give up and turn to something else or manage to finally get a strip in between my teeth. Anyway at over 60 I'm  having some orthodontal work done and that does mean braces....first I've ever had with them...and my obession with flossing and my great gums I've worried sick about how to maintain that. Along comes these picks and on reviews alone and sight unseen I took a chance. They came today and they are perfect for my needs they are getting between some teeth that no floss could get between. The only bad thing about them is they are so thin it makes them potential sharp edge could cut a gum. I'm prepared to be careful and use them careful to avoid that. But they more than outweigh the dangers that may or may not lurk there. Also they seem to hold up. I can get through a full set of teeth without bending or breaking them usually. And the handly little dispenser is great for travel or handbag. If careful you might use one for several days. And you could probably sanitize them if you choose with mouth wash. Six packs means about six months supply. I'm happy with these..not so happy with the ordeal of braces. But this is going to make it much easier on my mind and stress level while going through it. I've tried some plastic like dental picks similar to tooth picks and tiny brush on one end but they are no where as thin as these.

4.0,A331BHAR0TRLWT,B00592MMPA,"I am a big fan of long wearing lip glosses and lipsticks and have been wearing a lot of matte glosses lately. When I saw this lip color from ELF, I decided to try it. It was so inexpressive I had nothing to lose really. I bought the shade Praline not really knowing exactly what color it was. On my lips, it is a light cinnamony shade with a bit of brown. It's subtle. I have rosy lips and this tones the red down and makes my lips look more neutral.

The stick is pointy so you can line your lips first then fill them in. On the other side of the stick is a build in sharpener. I really like that. The color is  creamy without being overly so. It is not a true matte and it doesn't wear like one. It will wear off after a few hours especially if I eat or drink. It does transfer onto glasses and things so it definitely is not like my matte lipglosses. But I like the subtle color and the price as well. I don't mind reapplying the color. My lips look less dry and wrinkly than they do with liquid matte gloss so it's a nice change. It's a long wearing lip pencil. Well, longer wearing that bullet lipsticks anyway.

For the low price I am going with 4 stars. if I paid $20 for this, I would go with 3 because it does transfer and wears off  But the price can't be beat and it feels nice on my lips.

4.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B00592MMPA,"I like wearing bold lip colors and I hadn't tried anything new from e.l.f. for awhile so I added this on to a recent order.  I am mostly happy with it.

If you are worried that it was going to be too bold, you don't need to.  Although this is called ""wine,"" I'd classify it more as a cool red.  (I did need some more cool reds in my collection, so that is OK by me.)  It is not quite as pigmented as the official product image would have you believe.  With a light application and/or blotting, this should work for a lot of people.  Or, you can wear it full strength like I did!

This does come off when you eat and drink so you will need to reapply throughout the day.  However, it is very convenient to reapply.  It is small in size and fits easily in a purse, plus the cap stays on so you don't have to worry about it getting everywhere in your bag.  The tip is good for going around the outline of your lips, and you can kind of use the flat of the side to fill in elsewhere.  I have not had any trouble with bleeding, feathering, or migration, although this would certainly work with a lip liner if that is a concern to you.  (Also, for what it's worth, this isn't a hugely messy product.  I have some lipsticks where if your hair touches your lips even for a second, you end up with streaks of color on your face when you brush it away.  This product does NOT do that.)

For some reason, the outer box says you need to sharpen this with a sharpener.  I guess they didn't read over their template very well before adapting it for a new product.  This actually has a twist-up applicator that works pretty well.  No sharpener needed.  (And it is a good twist-up applicator, not one where you are constantly worried about the product breaking off.)

This is not drying, but it is not the most moisturizing lipstick I've ever tried.  It is kind of middle of the road in that regard, for me.  I will probably be reserving it in the future for times when my lips are in great shape (so, not winter when everything is dry).

In the end, I do like the color, though it is lighter than expected.  This is super easy to apply and convenient to carry around for reapplication purposes.  I wish it was a bit more moisturizing, but I can definitely live with it the way it is.",pretty good performance for something so inexpensive,"e.l.f. Matte Lip Color, Praline, 0.05 Ounce"

5.0,A2EWF2OWK60DJW,B005DMBC0C,"After years and years and YEARS of searching for some sort of SPF product that would keep my lips from burning, I can't believe it's this Lip Ink shine layer that has finally done it for me.  I'd tried every highly touted product; bull frog, white-ish zinc products, lipsticks with high SPF, and inevitably if I was out in the sun all day, my lips would be horribly swollen the next day - the problem (as I assessed it) was that with my mouth slightly open while breathing hard (running around playing frisbee or kadima on the beach), my lower lip caught the sunshine - the angle from above being such that the direct sun would hit on my lower lip right where the dry outer lip transitioned to the wet 'inner' lip where lipstick and lip balm didn't seem to stay on, and I was simply at a loss to find *anything* that would protect that area without immediately wearing off by lip licking or whatever - I mean you know what I'm talking about, we have lips - lipstick doesn't stay on the 'inside' of your mouth.... so I was seriously fearing I'd develop lip cancer and live the last few decades of my life with my lips removed and horribly disfigured (I have a morbid imagination).

So then last year I discovered the lip ink with this lip shine moisturizing top coat (which I love for all day wear) but I was VERY FEARFUL of really putting it to the test and wearing it without any additional sunscreen on my lips - but I was cautiously thrilled when the first attempt of a half day at the beach did not result in any swollen lips.  Then I tried it again and again, on longer days until I was out there from 9am to 6pm in the full on summer sun (reapplying the shine layer whenever I noticed my lips getting dry) and miraculously - this is the first and only product to truly protect my lips, without any hint of burning, tenderness, or swelling the next day.

I find myself wondering how it really works, because it's a 'light' smooth innocuous non-viscous layer, it's not like it's glued on my lips or even waterproof - and yet it really works.  I think if it's possible, maybe there is some protective element that absorbs into the skin so it works even if it wears off temporarily?

I would like to add for anyone with burn-sensitive lips that is going to use this as lip sunscreen, the lip ink COLOR layer does not have any SPF and I had not realized that and wore that by itself without reapplying the clear shine layer and my lips DID BURN.  But after looking up the product info, that is what they do specify - no SPF on the color layer, all the SPF is in the shine layer.  But it is PLENTY effective as long as you keep reapplying.  And if that wasn't great enough - you can look fabulous on the beach with your shiny fresh lip-ink color lips!

I used this after washing and conditioning  my hair and sprayed a few pumps in my hands and distributed through my hair concentrating more at the ends and less in the front ,just a few tiny dabs because if you use to much you may end up with greasy hair. Took me a few trys before I got this right. This is a light oil on the thicker side not runny like some. This left my hair looking great all through the day  without any frizz. This also left a brilliant shine I didn't have to use any other products with this. Works excellent with heating tools also. So now my daughter and I share this and I swear by this product especially if your hair is dry and frizzy.

Aquaphor is a more multipurpose ointment. This huge jar will last for ages. It is very thick and slightly yellow. It slathers on and forms a protective coating that keeps out the elements and seals in moisture. I use it for my lips, heels, any new tattoos I get and my husband uses it for his hands at home when he is relaxing. He didn't like the thick feel at first but he saw the improvement and is now using it often. Hand creams couldn't begin to heal his hands. When winter comes (and it's just about here in New York!), I will use this very sparingly on my face when I am out in the snow and cold to keep my skin from getting chapped and windburned. There are a million uses for Aquaphor and I will buy it again. There is no scent and a little goes a very long way.

I use it for dry and cracked heels and it helps me keep them crack free and pain free. The cream is rich and protective on  my heels but it leave my hands tacky and grease as well.  After spreading it on my heels I need to wash my hands.  It is a small price to pay for having the protective film on my problem areas.

Overall:
1. It is effective
2. It is unscented
3. The effect lasts a fairly long time, I apply it once a day
4. The same cream comes in variety of containers.  I use a big tub at home, and carry a small tube in my purse.

4.0,AW7BIYHXUIZ62,B006MRPMMG,"Head and Shoulders is well established as effective in successfully combating dandruff, but I had gave up on using it years ago -- driven away by the harsh unpleasant scent.  This new Head and Shoulders Green Apple scented dandruff shampoo is an improvement.

As always, the active dandruff fighting ingredient is pyrithione zinc, effective and an approved over-the-counter antifungal/antibacterial agent.

As a shampoo product, I found this product to deliver rich, thick lather, rinses clean, and smells great.  The green apple fragrance, by the way, is not sharp or bold, but muted, reasonably pleasant, and you'll not likely notice it unless you intentionallt take a sniff.  I also chose to use a separate (different branded) post-shampoo conditioner.  Afterwards, I was very pleased with my hair - soft and manageable as one expects with a quality shampoo and conditioning.

I don't currently have a dandruff problem, so being a fan of moderation in all things chemical or medicinal, I'll mix in use of this Head and Shoulders for about every other shampooing, or to get the recommended treatment about twice a week.",Head and Shoulders performance with a nice scent (finally),Head and Shoulders Green Apple 2-In-1 Dandruff Shampoo And Conditioner 23.7 F

I follow this up with Nexxus Polymedic, and L'Oreal (pink top) tube of color shampoo and conditioner. Once per month, and I leave the conditioner on for about 10 minutes with a cap.

The gold flecks are not glittery at all and they add just a touch of sheen.  I also have the Nars Multiple in Orgasm, which I use first, then I go over it with the Orgasm powder formula, which together, provide all day wear.  The Super Orgasm is a coral flecked with gold, more gold than the Orgasm but still subtle.  Coral is a universally flattering shade and is especially pretty with summer colors.  Even in the winter, it keeps me from looking sallow.  Although I'm light, but not fair, with hazel eyes and dark blond hair, Super Orgasm would be equally pretty on medium or olive skin or African American coloring.  The formula lasts all day without changing color or fading, so you won't need to touch it up.  I love Nars makeup, except the foundation, and I use the creme blush in Cactus Flower under the Super Orgasm powder blush to give it extra staying power.  My skin is oily but if you chose to use just the powder blush, it would be fine for normal or dry skin types.  I've had these Nars blushes for several years and have yet to put a dent in them. It takes only a swipe or two with a brush to get the proper amount of product.

If you already have some kind of 'orange' vibe going on, you probably want to steer away from this one. I am pasty pale with auburn/copper red hair, this just made me look like the Wendy's sign. It was not good with my base coloring.

I gave it 3 because no matter that the color looks bad on me, the product quality is still there. This would look incredible on someone with pigment in their skin, I'm almost envious of anyone who could wear this, just because it's so pretty in the pan.

UPDATE: I have the Orgasm/Laguna duo (reviews and photos and comparisons to other products coming soon) and it has been sitting ever since my horrifying discovery out in daylight, that there were glitter bits on my face from using the Orgasm blush. I have since discovered---your brush makes a LOT of difference. I switched to a very fluffy Real Techniques brush instead of my usual blush brush; it deposited gentle color and the glitter was very iffy. (As in, you couldn't really see obvious glitter but if you were verycloselikethis you could see tiny bits) I have revised my review a little bit. Still giving the advice that it's easy to overapply and, this color is sure not for everyone, but I don't want to shoot it with a silver bullet any more. If your skin has any tendency towards redness at all, I implore you to do a test run with this before you count on it looking good for any important (or public) event!

5.0,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B006WYJM8Y,"Some of the colors look scary in the compact because they are so highly pigmented. Exhibit A, for example, is a bright clownish looking orange-red that surely has scared off many a gal. But for those who know how to use a blush brush properly (ie, high quality bristles, good construction, a judicious amount of pressure, good blending), these babies pay off. And I mean pay off not just in beautiful color, but in how long they last, because this quality and pigmentation means you don't need to use a lot. One of these can last you a long, long time, even with daily use.

I have Exhibit A, Torrid, Taos, Crazed, Luster, and Mata Hari, which covers a range of warm and cool tones. Exhibit A is my fave go to red blush. Using just a touch of my duo-fibre MAC brush on it (ie MAC 187 brush), this deposits a beautiful, face-brightening blush to the cheeks. Too much and you look like Bozo, so this does require restraint.

Mata Hari is a lovely, feminine, cool pink-rose tone that I, who have olive skin, can wear and look like I was out walking briskly. Those two are my fave ones from NARS as they are matte. The others have some shimmer and require even more care in application and go well with a shiny gloss on the lips.

Luster is more like a highlighting color for me (it's a goldeny-lustrous color on me). It's pretty much the color of my skin with shimmer, so I can put it on without a color payoff, but it gives a nice glow that I like for days when I look ""tired"". A perking up thing. Also nice for adding glow when going out at night/to a party. On a lighter person, it's probably a nice warmth on the cheeks, sort of like a subtle bronzer. Could probably highlight eyes, all over, too. It's versatile.

Crazed is a deep raspberry pink with shimmer (ie, a cooler color that has glowiness). Taos is like a somewhat warm deep rosed-up red. It's a color that will definitely suit darker tones, but can be used by fairer women with much restraint. Torrid is a gorgeous deep peachy sort of tone with shimmer. I'm wearing it today with Manhunt by NARS (lipstick) overlaid with Red Devil coral-red gloss by MAC. Torrid is not as deeply-intense as Crazed or Taos, but it's not a shy color either. Will give a nice payoff.

I'm med-dark olive toned (NC44 in MAC) and all those look fine on me. I'm ordering Gilda to add to the peachy colors in my blush collection (which right now includes two MAC peachy tones and one by Physician's Formula). With summer coming in, I'm looking for peachier/warmer tones.

These are expensive-ish, but these are top-notch, and it's no wonder makeup artists and celebrities love NARS blushes. (Note: I don't own the much-touted, much-beloved, nearly legendary Orgasm, though, which is more suited to ligther-than-me gals, but it really is pretty in the pan. I have heard good things about Super Orgasm colorwise, if you don't mind having chunks of glitter fall off your brush.)

UPDATE: I got my Gilda blush and it's lovely. A soft-textured, nicely-pigmented matte peach that will look fabulous with peachy-coral and more orangey glosses for Spring and summer, or even with nude glosses.","Among the absolute BEST blushes out there--beautiful colors, blendability, durability","NARS Blush, Gaiety"

I am a big believer in essential oils for mood and health and have a number of essential oil necklaces and bracelets but I liked this one so much because it has a hummingbird on it. I absolutely adore hummingbirds. I also liked that it was chunky and looked well made.

It definitely IS well made. The chain is sturdy and the one inch circular pendant is very detailed. You can see every detail of the hummingbird and flowers. It opens so you can out a can put a cotton ball or cotton round inside with essential oils on it. The openwork of the pendant allows the aroma to waft out but I doubt anyone would know it is an essential oil necklace because it is so pretty on its own. It's a bit of a Southwestern piece with a dangling drop at the end. I love it. It gets a lot of compliments and even more when I show people that the pendant opens to use an an essential oil holder. I suppose you could also put a photo or something similar inside as well.

In all, a very well made necklace/pendant by Nature's Alchemy. I attached some photos but these days they often don't show up so I can only hope. I have one where I am wearing the necklace and you can see my Fitbit Tracker through my top. Looks weird but you will get the idea of the size and length of the necklace.

At least most of the time.  There are a few times per month, when my gums are extra sensitive, that flossing irritates my gums, even with the Comfort Plus floss.

When given the opportunity to try Glide Pro-Health for Life, I was excited.  Since I'm over 50, and it's made by the same company that makes my normal floss, I figured it had to be even better.  I was disappointed.  This floss looks even thinner than the Comfort Plus that I normally use, so I assumed that it would be even less irritating to my gums than the Comfort Plus floss usually is.  Boy was I wrong!!!  Every time I floss with the Pro-Health for Life floss, my gums swell and hurt for at least a day.  This hurts worse than my normal (Comfort Plus) ever did -- and it hurts every time.

I gave this product one extra star because it has lasted me for 6 months, and I think I still have a month left in the bottle. I won't be buying it again, but feel like I should hand out another star simply because this product lasts such A LONG TIME. My usage averages twice a day, using a partial (mini) pump.

One other thing: I believe my bottle wasn't properly mixed or stirred or something. The first months of usage were terribly stinky, and left my skin so shiny with oil. Later in the bottle, the smell has eased up and I'm getting more of a matte look. Goodness knows what's going on.

For the record, my lines haven't improved and the darkness around my eyes is the same.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I've been using Skin2Spirit eye whip for a while now, as per the directions, waiting and waiting for improvement. Every time I apply it, I increasingly dislike it. The smell is strong and unpleasant, cloyingly sweet like coffee syrup.

Skin2Spirit Eye Whip comes in a pump that pumps out too much; I try to do a half pump and am occasionally successful in getting out the right amount. It has the consistency of a thick cream. It feels like it absorbs, however, it leaves an oily sheen wherever you've applied it. I can see the line of where my eye whip ends and my facial lotion begins, as my facial lotion is oil-free.

This eye whip reeks so much my family has commented to me at different times why I 'stink' like ice cream, or coffee, or candy. Keep in mind, these comments come long after I've applied it, after it's dried. To me, it smells like coffee ice cream that's been baking in the sun all day: very sweet, cloying, pungent. Also, when I dry my hair with a hair dryer, the scent becomes strong again--heat activated--to my dismay.

My discoloration and fine lines have NOT improved with continuous use. I feel like my fine lines are actually worsening with use of this product, or else the oily sheen makes them look worse. My dark circles haven't lightened one iota.

Another thing I don't like about the product is that after I purchased it, I received an email from the owner, Kat, asking me (in other words) to give it 5 stars OR contact her to fix whatever problem I have with the eye whip. And what she really means is ""pay for more of my products"".

I've also read these long passages she's written, commenting on other people's reviews. I find her involvement in reviews unprofessional, as it comes across as her wanting to control reviews. Honest reviews can improve products because it gives companies feedback, without having to pay focus groups.

Kat also claims this eye whip works on ""99 out of 100"" people. Yeah, right. There is absolutely no science backing up this claim. I've worked in skin studies and NO company can honestly make this claim. I wish Kat would just tout the indisputable positives of the product: cruelty-free, vegan, entirely natural, paraben free, etc. instead of making more outlandish claims that aren't fact based.

I cannot recommend this product as it stands, and I wouldn't waste my money buying the unscented version either.",UPDATED: Reeks and Doesn't Work,"Age Defying Caffeine Eye Cream | 1 OZ | Puffy Eyes, Dark Circles, Fine Lines, Wrinkles | All Natural and Organic Ingredients: Contains Hyaluronic Acid | Cruelty Free | Made in USA!"
2.0,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B00B7V273E,"UPDATE ON 8-28-17:  Since I first purchased this, I've been getting really bad skin rashes and welts on my face after using this.  I have sensitive skin, and know that this product is causing the reaction since it only happens when I use this.  While I like the other Mad Hippie products I've tried, I'd stay away from this one if you have skin that is easily irritated.  One or more of the ingredients is definitely too strong if you have bad reactions!

I recently ordered the Mad Hippie Face Cream, Exfoliating Serum, and Antioxidant Facial Oil, and really like them a lot.  I've only been using them a few days, so I'll be sure to update my review as I use these more, but so far I like the fact that this is a healthier brand, with not many chemicals added to their products.

This Face Cream is not quite hydrating enough for me, but I've found that using the Antioxidant Facial Oil on top helps seal in moisture.

The Mad Hippie website also gives instructions for how to layer their products:

""We recommend gently massaging the vitamin C serum into your skin in the morning after washing and drying thoroughly.  Wait 5 minutes after applying the serum & apply the creams.  Apply the face cream to the entire face, including eye area, then apply the eye cream beside and below the eyesmaking sure to rub both creams in well, particularly around wrinkle prone areas.  Follow this with our extra hydrating antioxidant facial oil.

At night, follow the same steps but replace the vitamin C serum with an exfoliant:  either the exfoliating serum or vitamin A serum.  If just using the creams, wait a couple minutes after washing your face when skin is fully dry to apply. The facial SPF should be used as the final and last step of your morning routine.""",Be careful if you have sensitive skin!,Mad Hippie Face Cream with Anti Wrinkle Peptide Complex 1.0 ounces

The wrinkles I have are still noticeable not that I had expected them to magically disappear but I had a little hope that they may have been less noticeable. The reason for 3 stars is because it's natural ingredient list which is a plus and the excellent time frame as far as shipping and delivery. The packaging was good too. I am not gonna say I wouldnt give this another try at somepoint but for now I'm sticking to my other brand that I actually see results. This obviously works great for some as I have read in the reviews before placing my order but for the price and the fact I saw no results is enough for me to keep with my current brand.

It is TOTALLY AMAZING how well my gums are responding to this treatment. Here is a list below of the MANY PROS of this unit:

+ Effectiveness with my gums, teeth and mouth: After using this just a short time, my gums are getting more of that lighter pink and healthy look I need for my gum health. And they feel so clean after each use. In addition, my teeth even look cleaner! Love the fact that this has 10 different intensity levels. The one  five are very, very gentle on gums (great if you have tender or swollen gums or if you are new to Waterpik). However, I am up to power 8 on this and will be up to a 10 soon) and this intensity works wonderfully on my gums. They actually enjoy their beauty treatment so to speak.

+ Pause Button on the handle  This saves the day for me as when I want to pause, the button is at my fingertips and this helps me not to spray water all around my bathroom.

+ Ease of filling and cleaning - This unit is easy to fill, clean and empty and I like the fact that it is stationery in my bathroom and does not take much counter space.

+ Attachments and what is included  This comes with 6 attachments: Classic Jet Tip, Toothbrush Tip, Tongue Cleaner, Pik Pocket Tip (my favorite attachment as it is really helping my gums), Plaque Seeker Tip, and Orthodontic Tip.
In addition to the attachments, there is a Quick Start sheet to show you how to setup the Waterpik and also there is a small owners manual that has much information on how to use each attachment and how to overall use the Waterpik with pictures and step by steps.

+ Quality and Sound: This unit is almost whisper quiet as the motor is very smooth yet heavy duty at the same time. This is a very superbly made Waterpik!

Loud, sounds like Barbie handling a concrete drill.
Constantly sprays. The spraying, doesn't stop unless you press the blue button. To me, that's backwards. It should turn on when I press the handle button, but the real on button is on the side. However, you get used to it quick after you sprayed water everywhere a few times :D.
Can't replace flossing (unfortunately you'd need a sandblaster to replace string flossing, and that would be painful.)
Your mouth will fill with water quickly, so you have to spit multiple times (really not a big deal but took time to get used to.)

Pros:

I found that it didn't want to start working..or pumping actually when I attemped to prime it so to speak as the directions tell you. I set it up for that and after many minutes nothing happening. HUH...I was aware others wrote in that it was dead on arrival. But I could hear the pump being actively trying to work...just no water. So I ever so slightly lifted the corner the pump hole is on the water canister facing the pik it's on your left side towards the front corner...anyway I lifted it just a real tiny amount like maybe less than 1/4 inch or even no more than an 1/8 even. And a couple bubbles came up and I set it back down seating it again and the water came through right after that. So it was an air lock. That simple and that simple a fix but sometimes an airlock might be larger than the few small bubbles I had emerge. So you might have to work it a bit  maybe even shake it back and forth gentle of course. This kind of information might be helpful and prevent returns in the future. But the sellers need to realize this and tell you or warn you in the descriptions. Also Really WATERPIK should have this in it's brochure or manual as it is and tell you right off that it can occur.

5.0,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B000FOI48G,"When i was 16 my dentist told me to buy a Waterpik as an alternative to flossing which I didn't like then or now. Many years have past and I have shot through quite a few Waterpik models and this is the current one I own. It is a little more evolved than its predecessors, but it still performs in pretty much the same way it always has. You fill the reservoir with water, attach the head to the handle which has a control to turn the water stream on and off, and then turn the device on to produce a spray of water as you move the head around to remove debris from between your teeth and gums. I think of the Waterpik as a power washer for the teeth and gums because it forces out pressurized water to irrigate those areas.
This model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. It also comes with six different tips. While I use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.
Other than eliminating the need to floss, the Waterpik has been beneficial to me. My teeth are always clean, I don't have gum disease, plaque, dental decay, etc.

First, read the instructions.  Start off with low pressure as this little pump can shoot out quite an aquatic projectile!  Just make sure you have the nozzle turned AWAY from your eyes.  NEVER let this anywhere near your eyes.  Once you have regulated the flow to where you want it, you are ready to enter a whole new world of oral health!

This little Godsend also comes with a tongue cleaner.  After you give yourself a good oral cleansing, you and your dentist will have entered into a new phase of your oral health partnership.  This is EXCELLENT for your tongue, teeth and gums and does a very thorough job.  You reduce placque and bacteria considerably and the water jet can reach places where dental floss never reaches.",Flowing With Oral Health,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser
4.0,A1EVV74UQYVKRY,B000FOI48G,"My 12 year old just got braces for the first time and the procedure to floss between his teeth was never going to happen. So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...",Good Waterpik with lots of Nozzle Choices,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser
5.0,A1QBOC76MIOJYP,B000FOI48G,"While this Waterpik is not a total alternative for traditional flossing, it sure does help a ton if you have braces! It saves sooo much time and effort. Honestly, if I use this and then use regular floss string afterward, I never have anything come out on the string. I love this Waterpik! My teeth feel so clean after using it.

It is easy to use. You just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. It is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! I use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. The different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. It flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. The coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.

I use a basin full of water, then refill with half water/half mouthwash and my mouth and teeth feel so clean and so smooth. It feels like I just left the dentist. It is also easy to clean from behind the teeth as well.

This is definitely one of the best investments I have made. I definitely recommend this wether you have braces or not. My kids even like using it. I bought extra heads for it so they each have their own and can just pop it on when they use the Waterpik.",A must have for braces!,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser

5.0,A2JCJJNY43QQIV,B000FOI48G,"I've always prided myself on my good teeth. I thought that flossing and brushing was enough...that was until I went to the dentist, and he said I had the beginnings of periodontal disease. That scared the hell out of me.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The dentist HADN'T recommended a Waterpik, but I knew I had to go to the extreme to beat back the periodontal enemy. My teeth are so clean, they squeak!",Waterpik first timer (for the product AND periodontal disease!),Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser
5.0,A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,B000FOI48G,"This is an outstanding product!  I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!

To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.

I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).

The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.

Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.

The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.

In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.

Good performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.",Clean teeth and fresh breath!,Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser

5.0,A2BVRKJ12P1HDY,B00C6NZH3E,"I'm 48 and I have been shaving with Norelco Electric Razors since I was about 16.  My first Norelco was a hand me down from my Grandfather, a two header.  My Great Grandfathers, Grandfather and Dad have all shaved with Norelcos. I collect them and have a vast number in my collection.  I have had them to go out before and Philips Norelco was always quick to replace the defective model.  My pride and joy of my Norelcos is my Spectra 8894xl James Bond Electric Razor. It give a very close shave and I still shave with it once and awhile. I recently replaced the blades in it and it still delivers a close comfortable shave. I am always looking for a way to get a close shave with an electric.  I have a refurbished Smart Touchxl and it to shaves really close. Now on to Senso Touch 1250cc.  I purachased a Senso Touch 1250x at Walmart for $217 including tax, then I saw the 1250cc on Amazon from Electronic Sonic for only $225 and with fast shipping, the total price was $235. I returned the 1250x back to Walmart and got the 1250cc on Amazon from Electronic Sonic.  I was able to get the razor with the jet clean system on Amazon for only $18 more, a deal! I checked around at Target and a few other stores and there were no stores in my state that carried the 1250cc only the 1250x. It took only 3 days to receive this razor.  It ships by UPS.  I have a heavy dark beard and usually have to shave twice a day.  I never did get a close shave with my Arcitec 1050cc. It took me about 7 min. to get anything that even resembled a descent shave.  I gave my Arcitec to my Dad 68 who has a light beard and he loves it. All I can say about the shave that I get from Senso Touch is WOW! It is close and leaves your face feeling really smooth! I shave with it both wet and dry, but the wet shave is very comfortable and resembles the shave that I use to get with my old Cool Skin which was only a wet shaver. The razor comes in a big box and resembles a present. It is very expensive, but let me tell you, this razor is worth the extra money! It  takes a while to open it which in it are several smaller boxes which contain various parts of the shaving system. It really is a shaving system and it is was well worth the extra money. In the box, you will find the razor, the jet clean system, a bottle of jet clean solution, a charging stand ( charging stand does not come with the Arcitec 1050cc ), a soft pouch ( which is much better than the storage and charging pod of the Arcitec 1050cc ), a cleaning  brush, a protective cap, a power cord, and a quick start guide, and a useage booklet. On the razor itsself is a 3 level battery display which shows: cleaning indicator, battery high and low indicators which are shown in blocks, replacement head indicator, and travel lock indicator. This is a ruby black frame with a hidden display.  The razor has the GyroFlex 3D System, UltraTrack Heads, and SkinGlide System. This razor is Aquatec which means you can shave with it both wet and dry. This razor has a EasyGrip which ensures complete control and extra precision. The razor heads unlike the Arcitec can be taken apart and each one cleaned individually and you can wash out the razor and just let it dry. The jet clean system, which is very cool to watch in action, cleans and lubracates the razor heads.  I plan to use it about once a week to save on the cleaning solution.  Now when I shave, I use Afta Pre Electric and a little talc which helps to deliver a smooth shave. I do not use Williams Lectric Shave anymore as it cloggs the razor and it is very greasey.  Afterwards, I put on a little Nivea Post Shaving Balm.  When I shave wet, I use Nivea Shaving Gel. Philips tells you to wait about 3 weeks for your face to get ajusted to this shaving system.  I did experience a little irritation, red burn, on the lower part of my nck, but it could be due to fact I pressed too hard with the razor, but it is getting better evertime I shave. I love this razor and I am very happy with my purchase on Amazon. Like I said this razor is expensive, but I am a Pastor and I want to look good in the pulpit and this razor, so far is getting the job done! You can get the razor with a numeric display, but this model is sufficient for me.

4.0,A2O421DTA8J0RW,B00C6NZH3E,"This is a very stylish design for a shaver. It's lightweight and has an ergonomic feel in the hand and against the face according to my husband. When it arrived I realized we were dealing with a ""system"" as it came in a HUGE box full of multiple smaller boxes of components and accessories. The SensoTouch Shaver sort of has it's own little universe on my husband's bathroom counter right now and I wasn't expecting THAT. There's the razor itself, it's charging stand, it's cleaning box, the bottle of cleaning solution, the blade cover, the brush that cleans the moustache trimmer, and the travel case. All those gizmos serve good purposes and are nice to have in and of themselves, but my goodness... we've sort of gone beyond a quick morning shave and into the domain of manscaping at this point!

When it arrived, the battery was totally dead, so into the charger it went. Within about 90 minutes the battery was completely charged and ready to go. No fuss, no muss and no waiting overnight. That is a very nice feature - super fast charging. The power button is a flush push button on the front of the razor, easy to find and the power indicator is a row of L.E.D. lights going up the front of the unit with a futuristic look that just adds another touch of style to the whole look. Overall a really nice design.

The mustache trimmer pops in & out of the top of the unit just behind the trimmer blades easily. It works smoothly and did a nice job evenening up my husband's mustache. Though using too much pressure will result in a cut to the upper lip very quickly. The razor itself for actual beard/face shaving was close and did a fine job with only one real complaint from the man of the house. He groused about the fact that the blades missed some of the hair along his neck line requiring multiple passes over the same area. We're not sure why this happened - it may be the location of the area, it may be that the hair on the neck line is finer than the hair on the rest of his face or it may be something about the razor. What he did say was that shaving with a regular hand razor or his ancient Norelco electric razor he did not need to make multiple passes in the same way as with this new SensoTouch 3d Razor. So overall... he does like this razor and will continue to use it, but wishes it took up less real estate on his counter top.

3.0,A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,B00C92OA30,"The concept behind the Magic Wonder Holder Clip is very simple.  Basically, take a strand from one side of the head, cross it over the braider and place it in the groove on the other side.  Start from the top and keep alternating sides.

At the beginning of the braid, we have to hold onto the hair and the braider.  After a few strands have been gathered, we can let go and use both hands to just gather hair.  It's easier to use this on someone else than on oneself.  If you're like me and are not coordinated enough to French braid your daughter's hair, this might help.

The one thing I don't like is the length.  I often want to end but can't.  I ended up cutting off a bit of it and that worked.  Just use scissors.  Cutting off the end also helps the pointy end from pointing out of the hair.

Another problem is visibility: the gray color peeks through the hair.  If it were available in black, brown or blond, that would camouflage better.

It's not a bad braid, just not a great one.  Since all the hair ends up gathered under the braider, the ponytail at the end is not as nice as in a real French braid.  Instead of having three groups of strands to work with, we get a big, fat wad.  At least that's how it is with shoulder length hair.  Maybe it works out better with longer hair.  Maybe I need more practice.",Hands-Free French Braid,Vktech Hair Braider Twist Styling Braid Tool Magic Wonder Holder Clip DIY French

The toothbrush has 5 settings, and it lists them in the description.  I prefer the sensitive setting, as I recently had gum surgery and am now very aware of how hard I am brushing, which leads me into that nice feature.  This toothbrush will slow and the red light will come on if you are brushing too hard.  I like that, because it reminds me to use lighter pressure.  It comes with a separate display that keeps track of how long you are brushing, and also has a clock.  The brush pauses when it is time to switch sides.  I like the carrying case, as you can place the unit and the separate brushes in it.

I think it is a bit much with the display, personally.  The separate display portion is kind of a hassle.  I also wish it had a setting memory.  Every time you restart the toothbrush, it starts over at the first setting, so I have to press the arrow down to get to the sensitive setting.  It takes about 7 seconds, so you have wasted that time with the brush out of your mouth, trying to find the correct setting you like.

I like it, it works well, there are just a few things I would prefer be different.  I prefer a little more of a simplistic toothbrush.",Nice toothbrush with several great features,"Crest + Oral-B Professional Gingivitis Kit, 1 Count"
5.0,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B00CZH3K1C,"The Crest + Oral-Professional Gingivitis Kit has an electric toothbrush plus timer and case, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash in a disposable tote bag. There is a selection of four brush heads included, and I like the spinning head the best.  I have been using an Oral-B 1000 model for a few weeks so can compare it to this high-end 5000 model.

The charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts. At least when new, the battery will last for more than week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings. There are several brushing modes, including one for sensitive teeth and a mode with longer brushing times.  The sensitive mode is noticeably gentler.

This model will alert when a 30 or 45 second brushing time per quadrant has finished, by pulsing and with the little radio timer.  I don't really like the timer feature but it would be very helpful to teach a child how to brush; the visual reinforcement is effective.

The brush tips change easily but don't come off under use and they have colored rings to identify brush heads for multiple users. The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic so it is comfortable and easy to grip. It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems. I would hesitate to actually immerse the bottom of the handle, though.

It is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes; it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque. Be especially careful if you have gum recession or crowns.  Fortunately, this model warns about using too much pressure.  I find this helpful.

There is an accessory that fits over the charging base to hold extra toothbrush heads which some may find useful as well as a carrying case.  I probably wouldn't bother with the weight and bulk when traveling and will continue to carry a manual toothbrush.

No complaints at all with this toothbrush except that the handle shows water and toothpaste residue and the heads are rather costly compared to a manual toothbrush. I do think it's worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing, although the less-expensive models have the same basic features.

The mouthwash is a smaller sized bottle, but plenty to see if you like it and if it works well for you. Toothpaste and floss are full sized. This is a mouth transformation kit. If you have gum issues, or just want to take better care of your gums, this is the kit for you.

Previously I was using Sonicare Diamondclean and I was in love with it. Once I tried this Oral B toothbrush, I gave up on my Sonicare. I am 37, I smoke cigarettes, drink A LOT of energy drinks, and have braces. I NEED extra gum care and this toothbrush along with the mouthwash and toothpaste give me that. I would say that the toothbrush alone has made a big difference from when I was using the Sonicare.

I love that I can actually feel it working on my gums. It really feels like a gum massage. The smaller part of the head that moves separately is an awesome addition. That is where I feel the extra attention and the gum care. My teeth feel SO CLEAN after brushing with this one. I like that it is a more vigorous cleaning than with the Sonicare. It actually took me a long time to get used to the gentle cleaning that Sonicare toothbrushes give. I had been using Sonicare for about 10 years, so eventually I got used to it, although I never really did feel like they were really scrubbing as much as I liked. My teeth felt clean, but there was just something missing. This Oral B fills in the gap and gives me everything I am looking for, and then some. I just feel like my whole mouth is clean and fresh after using the Oral B.

The mouthwash is great for gums. I put some in my Waterpik (half mouthwash/half water) and I can tell a difference in the health and appearance of my gums. I do not get sore spots anymore and the sensitive areas are gone. Because of my braces, I tend to get gaps between my teeth down at the gumline. Debris get in there from eating and it can be painful and stay sore for a while. This mouthwash in the Waterpik really helps with all of the irritation.

The toothpaste is pretty good, although I think I will stick to my regular whitening toothpaste. I like a bit more bold mint flavor and I do need the whitening benefits due to cigarette smoking. Otherwise, it seems like a good toothpaste. It is a smoother mint flavor and seems to have almost a soothing effect on sore areas of the gum and mouth, so that is a plus when needed.

Mainly, I am just super impressed with the toothbrush. I had also tried the Oral B 7000 (black) but I much prefer this 5000 version. The 7000 was very impressive and the first Oral B to really make me switch from Sonicare, but just too loud. The 5000 here in this bundle just provides a better experience overall, without all of the noise. I thought the 7000 would end up being better, but it is not. It is sleek looking in black, but I just prefer the 5000 - I mean I really LOVE IT. The attention to the gums and the way it cleans so thoroughly and literally reaches every surface of the tooth, (even all around my braces!!!) is just amazing.

If you are going to invest in a good toothbrush, this is THE ONE to buy. if you need the extra gum care and attention this is the kit to buy. You can buy the toothbrush separate if you do not want all of the extra products, but for the price, you might as well get the bundle and try out the mouthwash, toothpaste and floss and see how you like them.

I do not intend to go back to Sonicare after having used this Oral B. I NEVER thought I would say that.",Amazing cleaning and gum care,"Crest + Oral-B Professional Gingivitis Kit, 1 Count"
5.0,A2YKWYC3WQJX5J,B00CZH3K1C,"If my dentist offered this kit at a good price I's snap it up in a heartbeat! Or if it was a 'get all this other stuff free when you buy the toothbrush' kind of thing. It's all you need for a healthy mouth in a re-usable little tote. And if you happen to be a dentist looking at this, there is cute little 'luggage tag' attached to it that has a sleeve for your business card. In six months when your client is using the tote for groceries, they just might look at that tag and remember to make an appointment!

Now lets look at what's inside.
First, there is one of those toothbrushes that syncs with a fun little device that tells you how you're brushing. GREAT for kids, but really nice for adults, too. It will even tell you if you are brushing too hard or soft. I love it! It does everything but reach in your mouth and brush FOR you.
The included toothpaste is slightly runny for a stand-up tube, but tastes fresh.
Next there is the Crest mouthwash. They claim it doesn't sting, and they're right. The mint lasts just long enough, with some others it spoils your taste buds for hours.
Finally, some dental floss. I prefer flossing picks but it certainly completes the package.

4.0,A2LAS014NSRW72,B00CZH3K1C,"This is a complete set to get you started with the Electric toothbrush (for two to share)....four brush attachments, toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss.  But the star of the kit, the best thing about it for sure, is the enclosed clock and brushing ""meter"".  What it does is keeps track of how long you brush, giving you four stars for 30 seconds on each mouth quadrant.  You can also get a fifth star (for tongue) if you go a total of 2 1/2 minutes.  For me, that's not a big deal.  But for my six year old, the stars have been a boon to getting him to brush more thoroughly.

He brushes with enthusiasm now, and I've noticed his teeth looking much cleaner than with just a brush alone.  For me, it's a helpful reminder to brush longer than I was used to.  The whole set is convenient, with a countertop charger and no batteries being required.  And having a clock in the bathroom was new to me, and very convenient.

However, two things keep me from giving it five stars.  One, the price point.  I wouldn't pay more than $50 for this set.  In all actuality, it doesn't seem worth the extremely high price point.  I mean, a Crest tote bag?  What am I going to do with that?  I don't think the set warrants the price.

The other minor point about this is you have to brush with your mouth tightly closed or you get watery toothpaste sprayed all over the mirror and counter.  Not to mention your face!  My son has to brush before he dresses or his school shirts get ruined.  So, it's a minor thing to get used to, but sort of annoying.

In all, a great set that would be better if it were more affordable.",Excellent set but a steep price!,"Crest + Oral-B Professional Gingivitis Kit, 1 Count"
5.0,A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,B00CZH3LQG,"This is a great way to package everything (well, almost everything) needed for dental care in a single package. It includes an Oral-B powered toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, and floss. I'll cover each separately.

Oral-B 1000 - I have owned several Oral-B toothbrushes over the years, both basic models as well as their more advanced models. I find the 1000 series offers the best value by far. It doesn't have any of the bells and whistles as the more advanced (and much more expensive) models such as a separate display unit and multiple brushing modes, but it gets the job done and does it well. It's compact, easy to take along for travel, and simple to use.

While I've also used the Sonicare line of powered brushes, Oral-B is my favorite brand by far. I find it cleans my teeth better and the replacement heads (of which there are a variety to select from) are less expensive. My favorite heads are the Floss Action and the Extra Soft (not included in this kit - must be purchased separately). The heads in this kit (two are included - the Precision Clean and the Deep Sweep) are also good, but for my needs, not as effective as other head styles.

Toothpaste - I didn't care for the Crest toothpaste but that's due to the fact that I need to use a sensitive formulation. Other types, such as this, contribute to tooth pain for me. I didn't detract from the rating due to this since that's not a fault of the toothpaste.

Mouthwash - classic Scope. About as classic as you can get. Simple, tastes good, works well.

Floss - my usual brand is the Oral-B regular Glide so it was interesting to compare it with this version (the ""Pro-Health""). The Pro-Health seems to be thicker and more durable than the regular, but I can't say that it cleaned any better. Any version of Glide is, in my opinion, far better than any other floss if you have tightly spaced teeth. It gets between my teeth far more easily and comfortably than any other brand.

Overall, a great dental health kit that comes packed in a nice (but somewhat smallish) tote bag. Highly recommend!",A great all-in-one dental care package,"Crest + Oral-B Professional Daily Clean Kit, 1 Count"
5.0,A3OC93X866Z8TB,B00CZH3LQG,"I have a small bathroom counter, so there is little space for extra gadgets.  This toothbrush doesn't take up a lot of space, as the base is relatively small.  It fits easily in the corner of my counter.

It took over 8 hours to fully charge it the first time, but once it is charged, you can leave it resting on the charger when you aren't using it.  I love the small brush attachment, because I have a small mouth, and the bigger attachments don't work as well for me.  I have used a Sonic Care in the past, and I didn't care for the size of the brush and the charger was really big.  The Sonic Care tickled my mouth and if I barely pulled it out of my mouth, toothpaste sprayed all over my mirror.  That doesn't happen with this one, because the brush is small and easier to maneuver.  The only thing I think it's missing is a toothbrush cover for the brush.

Every 30 seconds, it beeps so you can change locations.  I brush the top outside, when it beeps, I switch to the top inside, etc.  It turns off when it is finished.  I like how it stops if you are brushing too hard.  This is very helpful, as I tend to do that.  I just recently had gum graft surgery for recession, and I am now very aware of how hard I am brushing now, so that I don't destroy my gums again.

You can buy larger brush attachments for this, and it comes with one.  I haven't used that one, as I prefer the size of the smaller one.  This whole package would be a great gift for someone who needs an electric toothbrush.

Note, this is not a waterpick.  There is no water to deal with...a nice change from the '70s when everyone had waterpiks spraying around.  But, it's not the neatest thing to use...you get toothpaste sprayed around the room if you aren't careful.

There are two brush heads included, one that spins and one that goes back-and-forth.  (I like the spinning head the best.)  This is my first experience with an electric toothbrush at home.

The charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts.  At least when new, the battery will last for a full week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings.  There is a red LED that flashes when power is low and a green LED that flashes while charging.

The brush tips change easily but don't come off under use and they have colored rings to identify brush heads for multiple users.  The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic so it is comfortable and easy to grip.  It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems.  I would hesitate to actually immerse the bottom of the handle.

No complaints at all with this toothbrush except that the heads are rather costly compared to a manual toothbrush.  I do think it's worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing.  This would be especially helpful for anyone with arthritis in the hands.

It is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes;  it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque.  Be especially careful if you have gum recession or crowns.

You work it into your skin for a couple of minutes, then leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing it off.  There are no unpronounceable ingredients in it, and it smells like peppermint.  It's a very thick bilious colored liquid dispensed through the bottle cap.  I've used it four times with great results on my skin and one unexpected but welcome side effect.

The MTC initially feels like mud, but there's a really refreshing tingle that's just great first thing in the morning.  If you're of the generation that used a product called Seabreeze, that's exactly the sensation, only stronger.  The tingle doesn't go away until the stuff is rinsed off, either, and skin feels really clean.  I have some large pores around my nose, and they're thoroughly flattened by
this stuff.

If you have dry skin, go easy with this, and use a good moisturizer afterwards.  I have an oily T Zone with dry cheeks, and have learned to concentrate on my oily areas with the MTC, with just a quick once over on the dryer areas of my face.  I've been using this just before showering in the morning, and then using the shower to rinse it off--and here's the unexpected side effect: my miserable early spring sinuses have improved!  I think it's the herbs in the product coupled with the steam from the shower, but my whole sinus area feels SO much more open.  Hooray!

I'm thrilled with this product.  My skin feels awake and energized, and the products I use daily--serums, moisturizer, and BB cream--just sink right in after use.

2.0,AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B00DY59MB6,"At first taste, the Crest Pro-Health for old folks seems pretty good.  There's no alcohol and consequently there is none of the tingly sensation some of us are accustomed to.

After using it, your breath is definitely minty fresh... BUT there's a weird chemical after-taste that lasts and lasts; which my husband and myself found to be unpleasant.

On the non-pro-health side, it's a chemical concoction.  It contains ""propylparaben"" which is know to mimic estrogen.  It also contains Red 33, which can be found in Cutex Nail Polish remover.

Now really, given that we are adults-over-50, can't we just have clear mouth wash.  Or whatever color the Cetylpyridinium Chloride gives the liquid.  Because that's the only active ingredient: Cetylpyridinium Chloride.  (also used in some pesticides because it fights fungus.)

4.0,A2JCJJNY43QQIV,B00EBZD0PW,"This is going to sound really stupid, but I could never figure out why certain shades of pink lipstick never looked the same on my lips as they did in arm swatches. I really never connected the thing is that I have pigmented lips, and because they pull red, any color always has a reddish cast to it. And definitely no pink lipstick, especially anything lighter than medium, ever looked right.

I started looking around to see if there was some product I could use, since foundation is just drying and causes flaking. I was told that MAC makes a good lip coverup, but it's $20 (why is everything at MAC $20 and up?) I don't have a problem spending the money, but since there's no freestanding MAC store near me, I thought I'd give this Etude House concealer a try.

And it's good. Unlike plain foundation, it's very glossy when you first apply it. It truly blots out your real lip color; it's like lip White-Out. In a mirror, you look like you're looking at a photo negative!

This stuff is way too glossy to put anything over it without blotting. The dry down takes forever without blotting, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that once I blotted, the white out effect was still very much there, just not glossy, and so, ready for lipstick. The one thing it does really well  is block out the red of my lips and give my lip products a much truer color payoff.

I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out. The only caution I'd say is you don't need to put on as much of this as I did; you'll just be wasting product, and there's no dry down when you overdo it!",White-Out for lips; gives you the true color your lipstick was meant to be!,[Etude House] Lip Perfume

I want my tummy flat and my hair poofy, somehow my body got confused - with opposite results, so I have flat, yet still frizzy, hair. In the meantime I'm at that ""I need a haircut"" stage where I'm not sure what I want to do with it, so it's sort of half grown out, not long enough for headbands or to hold back, not short enough to really be a style, just unmanageable.

I decided what the heck and tried some Toni&guy plumping whip to see if I could whip it back into shape. The whip is a semi solid, sort of like coconut oil texture when it gets cool. The scent is very light and doesn't really smell of anything, no floral or perfume smell. The directions say to use a walnut size scoop, but since my hair is short I used about half that. Towel dry, scoop, put on hair, run through, dry. Easy enough, the whip didn't feel heavy on my fingers or hair, it rubbed through easily and I got out my blow dryer and went to work.

The crown and top of my hair plumped right up, and styled easily. I blew it flat by the ears so it wouldn't stick out and that worked too, so if you're doing a convoluted have lift half flat style this will work just fine. There is no residue feeling when I run my hand through my hair, and the volume probably increased by a good half.

I'm very pleased with the Tono&Guy (Liked the shampoo too, but that's another review) and my plump hair, now if my tummy would just get the memo I'd be set.",Volume,"Toni&amp;Guy Glamour Volume Plumping Whip, 2.82 Fluid Ounce"

4.0,A2R1HUYHXV7H18,B00EF1QRMU,"This looks like a cold cream when you open the jar.  It's just a bit thinner than a cream like that.  You towel dry your hair, then apply it at the roots.  As it dries, it gives you a bit of root stiffies that actually plumps the hair up away from the head, so it adds some volume and thickness.  It works a bit like a mousse, but is a good bit stronger than that.
I didn't like the way my hair felt though.  Even after brushing, my hair felt a bit dirty, like it does with heavier products.
It smells nice, but the scent wasn't very strong and was rather nondescript to me.  I suspect it might work best on shorter hair that needs a lot of volume and a more sculpted look.

I have shoulder length, thin, flat, professionally colored/highlighted hair.  I was expecting a very light product because of the whip name, but it wasn't. It was thicker than a mousse, but lighter than a cream. It does have a nice texture and scent. They recommend using a walnut size amount. That may work for thicker hair. I found the more I used, the more I felt like I had a heavy hair product on my roots, even when my hair was dry. This product did not add any extra volume to my flat hair than a normal blow dry would. It does control fly away hair. Even on a second day blow out, it still kept the fly aways under control.

I would recommend this product depending on your hair texture and needs. Right now it's winter where I live and the temperature has been low twenties. Which means lots of static and fly away hair.

Luckily, I read the back before even hopping into the shower.  Now, I think the scent may be polarizing. For me, it translated as ""pleasant"" and ""clean"" (I thought it smelled like a blend of citrus and mint, which I found to be a very refreshing fragrance). I think because I gravitate towards the uncommon, this registered as very likeable. Now, I definitely used WAY too much the first time. (I think I just enjoyed the texture and the experience. LOL!) So, just be careful of that. Finally, it is easy to distribute and rinsed super clean. My only concern is any potential rust from the canister. I usually leave my shampoo and conditioner in the shower area ... but I was worried that this container could stain my tub/shower (I had done this accidentally with a shave cream many years ago). So, I find myself taking this into the shower and carrying it out of the shower ... and occasionally forgetting it, wrapping a towel around me and going to grab it. I guess, I'm flummoxed by metal containers in the shower.

Understand, the conditioning aspect is very light (so as to allow for volume and movement), so if you have damaged hair, this may not be the best choice.

I used it with additional styling products and without (just the conditioning mousse).

It worked well no matter the alternatives I used.

And that was actually okay for my hair, since it's not that I have fine hair, but that I've cut it from being long and thick, to a shorter and thick hair style. A style that needs a lot of body and not be weighed down by heavy products, or else I don't get the desired effect.

But that's not how this product is designed to work. It's supposed to be washed out in the shower. This works very well for making hair soft but light and fluffy. And it really worked well for my teen daughter, who has very fine thin hair. Normally she can't use any conditioner in her hair. She's at an age where her hair is getting very oily every single day, and already having very fine thin hair, the two are a bad combination. So she has to use clarifying shampoo every day, and no conditioner, just to keep her hair nice.

This conditioner however is so light and washes away well in the shower, that she can use it to help soften her hair without completely weighing it down and adding to her oily hair issues. It also has a very nice citrus cent to it.

It worked pretty well but left just a slight bit of heaviness to my fine hair.  Then I read the directions which I should have done before using it. The next couple times I used it as instructed and I liked the results better. It seemed to add a little volume and body to my fine hair. It didn't do a super job of detangling though. The foam is very full and luxurious. The dispensing mechanism is nice because it puts quite a large amount in your hand with only a light touch. It makes it very easy to use.

I love the fragrance which smells like fresh grapefruit and citrus. It's very natural scent, not like something cooked up in a lab. It's one of my favorite things about the product.

3.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B00GHJOM2U,"This may be suitable for some people but it is not really what I need in an eye cream.

Here are the ingredients since the listing on the product page seems to cut off:

Water, caprylic/capric triglyceride, glyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, PEG-100 stearate, dimethicone, stearic acid, cetearyl glucoside, tocopherol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, lavender flower extract, camellia sinensis leaf extract, grape seed oil, bisabolol, jojoba seed oil, sodium hyaluronate, panthenol, PEG/PPG-4/12 dimethicone, silica, xanthan gum, phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, aminomethyl propanol.

There is nothing in here that really makes it any more special than an average facial moisturizer.  It has some moisturizing ingredients (caprylic/capric triglycerides, glycerin, aloe, sodium hyaluronate, grapeseed oil, jojoba oil).  It has some antioxidants (from the tea leaf extract).  The moisturizing effects may help diminish the appearance of fine lines; hyaluronate, for example, holds on to a lot of water and may have a plumping effect.  I don't have much in the way of fine lines, but I am not really seeing a difference in the ones I do have after applying this every morning for awhile now.

For what it's worth, this does have some silicones in it.

If you have really sensitive eyes and can't use most other eye creams, this could be an option for you.  It is non-irritating, even when used on sensitive/thin skin.  I have been using this in the morning before putting in my contact lenses and it doesn't bother my eyes at all.  You don't need a lot at once so one container will last a long time, making this a pretty good value.

But, in the end, I feel like this is not the eye cream for me.  I am looking for something with a few more active ingredients designed specifically for the eye area.",definitely good for sensitive skin but basically just a facial moisturizer,"Home Health Evercln, Face Cream, 1.69 Fluid Ounce"

All around Lotus WAS one of my favorites, but when I started to reorder I saw comments that the company has changed the formula and that it is no longer organic and may even contain lead. Lotus is also much higher priced than this E.l.f product (I paid the"" add on"" price of just over $2). I thought, ""I can't beat that price, even it turns out I don't like it."" For the price I probably should give it 5 stars but I'm not fond of this color, it is rose as it states but it is much lighter than I expected. I also think I'll have to apply it frequently. It feels GREAT on though. It's very moisturizing. I will try another color, hopefully one that is darker. I like the ""coffee"", deep burgundy colors better. I kinda knew from the picture that I might think this one was too light for my liking so I'm not complaining just giving my honest opinion. I want to say that I love it, but I honestly can't. Maybe I'll love the next color (which I will try), but even then it'll have to prove to have better staying power before I'll be able to say I love it. :-)  As a side note: Burt Bees shimmer lip balm is another favorite, when I find the right color, in part for it's staying power.

5.0,A1BRCVMQ7C9CGJ,B00I2OR6YE,"Very nice set of brushes! This comes with a complete set of brushes all with different shapes and sizes for different purposes. It has all kinds of different brushes for any need you have. This set will help you to get the look that want when applying your makeup. They all have long smooth handles and the brushes are very soft. I love the blush brush a lot and the angled eyeliner brush. It helps to blend in my eyeliner so it looks more natural. In addition to the makeup brushes, you also get the brush holder, which helps to keep all your brushes neat and organized all together. It also is easy to travel with because you just put one of the cylinder holders on top of the other with all your brushes inside and woolah. They can easily travel with you. Now you can always have all your makeup brushes together when you travel. This was a great idea and I love that. None of the brushes will ever be squished or lost in this cylinder case. The makeup brushes stay protected.

This also looks quite nice on your dresser or in your bathroom; wherever it is you apply your makeup. The leather pink cylinder cases are cute and attractive and hold all the brushes nicely. In addition, if you have to move your makeup brushes daily because you don't have enough room to keep them out when you do your makeup they are very easy to move around because of the nice leather cases this comes with. Just pop the lid of one case onto the other case and they are protected from dust and the little pink case looks like a decorative item.

5.0,A3AYSYSLHU26U9,B00ICQV260,"I have never heard of Mamey Oil until I was given the opportunity to try this mascara. I am in my mid forty and it seems everything is either dropping or falling out, and that includes my eyelashes. I hardly ever wear makeup anymore except for moisturizer on my face since I have permanent eyeliner tattooed on my eye lids. I just do no like that heavy caked on makeup look.

IM Natural Mamey Mascara goes on light and dries flake free. Makes my lashes look natural and not like thick black spider legs or like I am going out for the night. Best of all it washes of so easily. However, I do wish the brush was longer and not so short and fat.

In regards to Mamey Oil, it comes from the Mamey fruit that grows in Mexico, Central America, Caribbean and south Florida to name a few. It has an excellent source of vitamin C, and B6, as well as a good source of vitamin E, potassium and copper. Besides being different ways to consume it, it can be used for hair and scalp and now proven to help thicken, strengthen and help grow longer lashes. Perfect match for me and my falling eyelashes.

I have only been using this mascara for a short period of time and I quickly noticed less lashes on my bosom or in my eyeballs. So yes I am a believer that it does help strengthen eyelashes. In regards to helping grow longer, only time will tell. I can tell you that this mascara does not clump and goes on light and not heavy.

Incredibly it is an 8 pack box so it should last you a long time.

4.0,AEC90GPFKLAAW,B00ICQV260,"I wear mascara for special occasions, but my two daughters wear it daily so I was pleased to accept a complimentary sample of IM Natural Mamey mascara for testing and review purposes. I wasn't familiar with mamey seed oil, but a quick Internet search showed that the oil from mamey seeds ""is rich in vitamins A, B, C and E, proteins, amino acids, fatty acids and minerals. It serves as a great moisturizer for dry skin and is known as a hair revitalizer"" and ""helps stimulate follicles to encourage growth and helps nourish your hair from the root to help it look healthier"". That sounds like a great ingredient to have in mascara - but will it be waterproof and make lashes look great?

I'm happy to report that the mascara IS waterproof, applies smoothly without clumps, and makes lashes look long, natural and defined. None of us had any allergic reaction to it after wearing it for a couple of days, and the description on Amazon says it's all-natural. The only thing we didn't like was the wand, which is a large conical brush. It takes a little getting used to, but we managed to apply the mascara without putting out an eye or over-applying the product.

With 8 tubes in this box, this is enough mascara to last a long time or to share with friends. It's a bargain when you compare the price to a single tube of drug store or makeup counter mascara.","Not fond of the wand, but beneficial for hair growth and waterproof","Im Natural Mamey Mascara (Value Pack of 8), Length and Volume for Super Long Lashes Guaranteed!"

I have been using this for about 6 months and it works amazingly well.  My skin is sensitive to fragrance and preservatives and this all natural scrub causes no irritation at all.  I use it daily and what I like best about it is that the granules dissolve very easily when I rinse my face with warm water.  I don't have to rub my skin hard, I let the crystals do the work.  I'm in my 50s but am still oily in my T zone but my cheeks occasionally get flaky.  This exfoliant is very gentle and it eliminates the flakiness while keeping my pores clear.  I have had zero blackheads since I started using this scrub every morning.  I use a foaming oil cleanser and mix in some of the crystals and give each section of my face a nice scrub.  My skin is uber sensitive but this scrub has caused no reaction.  I still use St Ives apricot scrub in the shower but it's considerably harder to wash off and the little apricot shells often get caught in my hairline.  Consequently, I've stopped using St Ives unless I'm washing my hair and can be assured that all of the scrub has been washed off.  When I don't wash my hair, I prefer to use the Clarisea crystals because they completely dissolve in water.  I like the fact that they are all natural and don't cause a problem for the environment like the beaded scrubs do (which are outlawed beginning in 2018, thank goodness).  The sea salt crystals completely disintegrate and dissolve in water.  This scrub keeps the flakiness at bay and is also great for my lips.  I use a retinol product at night and using these Clarisea crystals in the morning controls the sloughing skin nicely.  I always have a fresh smooth canvas for makeup when I use the Clarisea scrub.  I have now purchased two full size bottles and will continue to use it.  They last a long time because I only need a very small amount for each application.  They have no noticeable fragrance, which is good for me since I'm sensitive to fragranced cosmetics.  I highly recommend this scrub for all skin types.  It reveals fresh new skin every day and helps keep skin clear.  I don't use the crystals alone but rather in conjunction with a creamy cleanser so the crystals are not harsh.  But if you have troubled skin, you could very well just wet your face with warm water and use the crystals alone.  These crystals are great for clearing blackheads.  My skin looks so much better since I discovered this product.  I definitely recommend them.",Works great for me.,Rapid Detox Charcoal Exfoliant

  I know this will sound crazy, but, I have a very finicky cat who doesn't like to be brushed.  Well, she has a very finicky owner who thinks she should be brushed everyday.  We were at a standoff.
When this pink brush arrived, she paid a lot of attention to it. One day while brushing my hair, she came up to be and made that cat sound that turns your head.  :-#
I didn't know what she wanted, but as a joke, I tried to brush her with my brush...this Alaska brush.  She loved it!  She let me brush her for half an hour...a true miracle.
Well, needles to say, this is now kitty's brush, and at least twice a day she comes up to it, and meows.  She actually wants to be brushed!  I tell you it's a miracle...no more cat hair anywhere!

This brush is perfect after a shower and hair wash for anyone who has long or short hair. The bristles are soft and flexible and detangle hair with ease. The brush is a bright pink color, so it should be easy to find. It came well packaged and, enclosed in a hard plastic. Very easy to remove the plastic, and start brushing away.

For anyone with hair extensions this brush is perfect. It us also good with wigs and hair pieces. It did have a slight plastic odor outside of the box, but the odor dissipated after a bit.

I'm never going to like my local beach again, because it doesn't smell like the beach in this soap.  This is a dream beach, the kind of beach I want to wake up in.

I've been using this soap every day for a couple of weeks and the bar lasts and lasts.  The scent isn't quite as strong as it was initially, or maybe I'm used to it, but I bring it up to my nose every time I shower just to get a whiff of beach.

Endless summers spent swimming and waterskiing with little more than a slathering of cocoa butter on my face has left me with LOTS of sun damage and age spots.  I have used several dark spot correctors over the years and the one made by Clinique has managed to fade them, up to a point.  I also exfoliate regularly and use a mild facial peel weekly.  Sadly, even after all that my skin still looks dull and uneven.

This Illuminating serum somehow makes my skin look brighter, as in glowing, even after just one use.  It must have some kind of reflecting particles in it to diffuse light or something, or else how can it work so fast?  I don't know, but the brightening effect gets better with consistent use.  I can tell a difference when I'm in a hurry and don't put it on because my skin looks dull and lifeless.

3.0,A1BRCVMQ7C9CGJ,B00L1I1VMG,"I really wanted to try Crest Sensi-Stop Strips because I have really sensitive teeth. I knew I would be able to tell right away if it was working because my teeth are sensitive every day. After using the first strip, there was no relief and I was disappointed but I read in the instructions that it could use another strip the next day if you still have sensitivity. Well, I didn't want to wait until the next day and about an hour later, I went ahead and used a second strip. Now, this time I did notice a tiny bit of relief. I was surprised by that but still wished it were stronger. I think the product works but you probably will have to use more than one strip for each tooth. I don't like the fact that these are so short either. I expected them to be the length of the Crest White Strips or other strips like that. These are more like a small patch that covers about 2 teeth or maybe 3 small teeth at the most. I think these strips could definitely be stronger since 2 gave me a tiny bit of relief but with 1, I never noticed any difference. I plan to use a third strip to see if I can make the sensitivity go completely away. I do like the fact that these are supposed to last 30 days. It hasn't been a month yet so I don't know if that is true. I still think these can be good for people who don't have as sensitive teeth as mine. Just wish they made each strip stronger or longer so they covered more teeth. These can be quite expensive for just 6 little strips (patches) so I feel like I should get more for my money. Especially if I have to use 2 or 3 strips just for one tooth. Starts to not feel worth the money.

4.0,A3S3R88HA0HZG3,B00L1I1VMG,These strips work to numb pain or cold sensitivity on teeth where the gum exposes a tiny bit of the dentin at the base of the tooth. Sometimes acidic foods can irritate this area and cause sensitivity. These strips are very easy to use. You just press one of the straps against the tooth and gum that is hurting and leave it in place for 10 minutes. I was really surprised that this actually worked and continued to work for several days. I am on the seventh day now and my tooth feels just slightly sensitive again. I do eat a lot of acidic foods and drink kombucha which is kind of sour so that may contribute to the strips not lasting as long.

The instructions do not say to trim the plastic strip to fit, but in actual use, it was necessary to trim the strip in order to get the strip in place and have a comfortable fit for an aching  lower molar.

These worked very well, my son (30 years old, lives with me because he is disabled) had a tooth ache two weeks ago, we used one of these and his tooth hasn't bothered him since, but it was awkward to put in place, after one failed attempt of him trying to put a strip, we resorted to trimming the wide plastic strip before removing the backing and I put on a pair of disposable medical gloves and put the strip in for him.

The next day, I put cold water in there and swished it around.  It was still sensitive, but I didn't have the screaming sensitivity that I usually have.  I think with continued use, this can dramatically minimize the sensitivity.

The strips are kind of hard to get off the sheet.  I wasn't sure if I was doing it right, and there weren't any instructions.  You have a big sheet of plastic with a little piece of the sensitivity strip in the middle.  You have to peel that part off, but it doesn't come off easily.  It is a little tricky to do.

5.0,AI8DDPX23JCV2,B00L88S190,"I am very skeptical when it comes to any product that says it reduces cellulite or gets rid of cellulite, because there is no instant fix for dimple thighs (except for maybe liposuction or laser treatments but my budget doesn't allow for that).  I have tried many lotions, creams, massagers and nothing has ever seems to make a difference that I can see and feel.  I say feel, in reference to how smooth my skin feels on the back of my thighs compared to the front of my thighs after using this powder mixed into a scrub I've been using on the back & sides of my thighs & butt.

Before I started using this seaweed powder in a scrub I did exfoliate my legs/thighs & butt regularly.  No joke, I used the green side of a Scotch-Brite kitchen sponge to exfoliate the skin on my legs.  This is how I know this is not just because I all of a sudden started paying more attention to my thighs and exfoliating them with a scrub (seaweed or not) that my skin feels like this.  I have other body scrubs I use regularly but since I have quit using those on my thighs and just started using the seaweed scrub on my thighs, my skin feel much more even and soft.

The recipe on the side of the jar says: 3 tbsp Seaweed Powder, 1/4 cup sea salt, 1/4 cup olive oil, drop of essential oil.
I sort of tweaked the recipe on the side of the jar and added a few extra things.. I used
4 tbsp Seaweed Powder
1/4 cup sea salt
1/4 cup sugar
1 tbsp olive oil
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar (optional)
1/2 cup coconut oil (fractionated (liquid) works best but you can melt solid coconut oil and it will work fine too) - I started with a 1/4 cup and added about a 1/4 cup more because I like my scrubs a little more liquidy
& last but not least, Peppermint essential oil - A LOT, like I think I used a tablespoon or more trying to cover up the smell of the apple cider vinegar (which I may leave out next time).

I also tried sort of like a face mask on my butt & thighs, equal parts seaweed powder and sodium bentonite clay (""Indian Healing Clay"") and water until smooth and put this on my face and then added peppermint oil and put the rest on my thighs for about 15-20 min.  I really think its the combination of the seaweed powder with the peppermint oil that has made my skin/thighs look and feel so much better.  After looking at the concoction I made I realized the amount of seaweed powder is less of an overall percentage of the final product than what the bottle recipe is.  So I'll definitely try what the bottle says next time.

I am so very pleased with this product.  I am very grateful I was given this product to review because I don't think I would have thought an ocean weed could do anything for my skin, my thighs, or cellulite because I've tried so many products claiming to help cellulite.  That being said, this seaweed powder is amazing, and I will definitely be purchasing more when it runs out because I like the results I see.

I was new to face peels.  This came with a e-book that described the process.  I got some baking soda, and a new artist's paintbrush and cottonballs, as recommended, to do my first peel.  It was easy.  The instructions had said for the first time to be only 2 minutes.  I used a kitchen timer and using the eyedropper and the brush, applied the 30% glycolic acid solution and left it on for 2 minutes.  It tingled a bit but that was all.

My face didn't look much different afterwards.  It was easy to get off.  My face felt a bit dry, so I followed up with hyaluronic acid serum.  I never did note any peeling, and I didn't have any redness, but in the days to follow I did notice that my skin seemed a bit brighter.  The next time I left it on for 5 minutes, because my face is pretty tough.  This time I felt a bit more tingling and I did have a bit of flaking.  My skin looks much brighter over all, and it seemed like it lightened my faded freckles up even more.

I like the product and will continue to use it until I find that sweet spot of time that's just right for me.  I can see where this treatment does help skin to look younger and more clear.  I haven't had any real progress with fine lines, but I can tell the potential is there and will happen with time and more treatments.  There's enough in the bottle for MANY treatments.  It only takes a bit.

 I recommend it, along with a good hyaluronic serum to follow the treatments.","Generous amount of product for multiple treatments, good instructions, safe and easy to use","Glycolic Acid 30% At Home Chemical Peel for Your Best Microdermabrasion.

I'm no stranger to peels; I know what my skin can handle, and I left it on for fifteen minutes. If you're new to these at home peels, I'd recommend starting with five minutes to see how your skin reacts.  This peel is mild enough to use a couple of times a week, and it's everything the manufacturer says it is.

There's no fragrance, and the solution comes in a dark blue dropper top bottle.  You only need a dropper full for a thin coat on face and neck.  After applying, there's a little tingle.  It's not unpleasant; it just lets you know the product is working.  The results are immediate.

It's safe to plan to use this the same day you want to look your best for an important event; it doesn't leave your skin red or raw, just refreshed.  I'd recommend using a hyurolonic oil or heavy-duty moisturizer afterwards.  Good stuff!

5.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B00MGK9Z8U,"I have this in ""Berry Seductive"" but I've had a great experience with it and would certainly purchase it in other colors.

As you can see from the product image, this comes with two products -- a lip stain and a balm -- in one container.  I have found that I only needed to apply the lip stain (or liquid lipstick, or whatever you want to call it) once and it lasted throughout an entire work day.  So they're not lying about the 16 hours (well, I probably wore it for more like 10 or 11 hours, but it still looked good and was a bit difficult to remove at the end of that time).  I applied it using the doefoot applicator it comes with and then kept my lips slightly open while I let it dry.

I gave it a few minutes and did other things to get ready, then applied the balm over it.  The balm has a similar applicator to the lip stain part.  The balm (or you might call it a gloss) is clear.  It did pick up some of the color of the stain on the applicator when I used it, but no big deal since I'm only going to ever use the balm *with* the stain.  Anyway, although the stain itself was rather drying, using the second step made this product completely comfortable to wear.  I did have to reapply the balm a few times throughout the day.

I did not get much color transfer to mugs and I did not lose much color over the course of the day.  I found the appearance of the product quite acceptable at the end of the day.  It was actually a bit difficult to get off; I used a dual phase liquid makeup remover on a cotton pad and I kind of had to scrub.  You may want to finish up with a lip scrub to ensure complete removal.  Anyway, this stuff has staying power.

The berry color I had was more of a cool red than a true berry color, at least on my lips.  I really liked the color.  I'm pale, but I think it would show up on people with darker skin tones as well.  This was non-irritating and didn't have a noticeable fragrance.

5.0,A2LAS014NSRW72,B00MH07GZ8,"I am astonished.  Really.  Truly.  I have somewhat dry skin with alot of sensitivity: it often feels as if it's sunburned.  When it's not. So I was hesitant to try a chemical peel, but wanted to because I have some major discoloration.  Mostly from sun damage, mostly on my cheekbones and cheeks.  Just little tan spots here and there. I also have a bit of small scars from old acne, almost as if they healed with a change in pigmentation.

SO, I tried this out, using the Ebook from the Carbon company for advice on how to do it.  I was sort of chicken so started with two minutes only, and I exfoliated with ExfoliKate by Kate Sommerville first.  Put it on, no sting, rinsed it off after two minutes.  Used a baking soda solution to neutralize the acid (will try and find the ebook link so you can see their recipe).  Rinsed more and more and then used the Serum designed to work with it (I will review it separately, it's called Hyaluronic Acid, also by Carbon).  I was expecting to feel sunburned the next day but didn't.

Here's the thing, it worked amazing the first time.  I noticed one side of my space especially looked clearer and more even (maybe I sat in the sun and one side is worse??).  I couldn't believe it.  I waited one week and did it again.  Still, an improvement. I really can't even explain.  It's just evener and the brown spots are almost gone.  I'm sticking to the two minute regimen for now, I'm still too chicken to go for longer.  I'm going to keep doing it weekly for now.

I did get a bit crazy and used it on my cleavage (decollete?) because I have many many discoloring sun spots.  Didn't notice as much improvement there, possibly because the discoloration is pretty bad.  Will keep trying.

The wildest thing was this, however: I did the back of my hands and the top of my feet as well.  (You only need a tiny bit).  My hands are quite beat up and discolored with various scars etc, and the top of my feet looked sort of awful because of a summer of flip-flops and weird tan lines and always dinging my feet on something or other.  There was hugely noticeable improvements in both of these areas.  Each time I followed the same regimen.

On my feet, I also used (the next day) a whitening cream from another manufacturer, and left it on all day. It really made my feet look pretty and softer and between it and the chemical peel, looks great for winter.

Very very pleased.

It smells great, just light and sort of spring fresh to me, not a heavy perfume. It rinsed out clean, but my very thick hair was still tangle free while wet. Once dry, my hair looks great! I have thick, lush hair that reaches the middle of my back in a blunt cut - no layers here. The wrong conditioner can make my hair look like a curtain. Nobody wants that.

4.0,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B00N2WQ2IW,"Since a conditioner affects your hair differently based on its unique qualities, I will first state that my hair is very long, thick, wavy, soft, and aging (I'm 50). It is not color treated. I have some flyaway hair and split ends, but nothing too overwhelming. My main concerns are shine enhancement/retention, ease of combing out, and body retention. My hair can take some pretty heavy conditioning without flattening out.

This conditioner left my hair very soft and made it easy to comb through my wet hair after shampooing and conditioning. It's creamy and thick so you don't need a large amount for coverage, even with relatively voluminous hair. While this didn't do too much to enhance shine, it didn't dull what I already had. I found that it smoothed hair a little less (some ""frizzy"" parts) than some conditioners in the lower portions (despite my attention to even distribution) and did a better job smoothing the top. It did not suppress the natural waves my hair has or weigh it down.

The fabric is thin (the black is see through in fact) but it's super comfy. It's meant to fit big and the arms are supposed to be tight ... it's almost a bat wing type of sleeve. I can't see wearing the hood - it's really not big enough. I wouldn't wear it off the shoulders - doesn't look good. Looks best over tight jeans with big earrings.

4.0,A2D1LPEUCTNT8X,B00NJ270ZY,"&nbsp;The name of this garment may set wrong expectations. A poncho is a single large sheet of fabric with an opening in the center, it may have a hood, it can be made out of different materials, but it does not have sleeves. This garment does. So it is not a poncho.

I would describe it as a loose fitting blouse with a large cowl neck. The neckline that is flowy and either drapes down or can be stretch over one or two shoulders. The blouse is made out of thin material, so it drapes well. Its loose fit is flattering as it does not cling to reveal fat rolls or any other body imperfections.

The material is thin, but I have worn it to work this week (we are having a cold December) by layering a sweater under it. I got the XL-3X size, but it is not too big as drapes well. The material is 95% Viscose and 5% Spandex. It is quite thin, but this what makes it drape well. The yoke is made out of double fabric, so it has a little more structure than the top itself. The sleeves are 3/4 length, they fit me comfortably. I wear it with the draped neckline it over pant/jeans. I got the one in black color so I spice it up with colorful scarves and layer with sweaters. This blouse is not a high end couture. It is a casual outfit. It does not look out of place at my work place.

Manufacturers instructions recommend to wash in cold water with similar colors. I washed the blouse by hand to see if it is colorfast, and discovered that it is colorfast and does not bleed, but it sheds black fibers. I washed 5 times and continued to shed fibers. This fibers are not individual threads, they look like fuzz. I am including a photo of what was left in my sink as the water draned. The fabric does not shed when it was dry, and when I took it off there was no shedding on my sweater.

So what's the bottom line? Not bad for a casual looking blouse, but overpriced due to the celebrity endorsement.

I love good face masks and buy singles all the time, hoping to one day find one that's perfect.  This one does deliver on it's promise to brighten my skin and tighten pores- I could tell a noticeable difference in my face when I took it off- my face seemed lighter in color, and brighter, and my pores were about as tight as they ever get.  I didn't really find that it reduced fine lines though - so far only the 'at home chemical peels' that I use really deliver strongly on that promise, though some various serums and creams do help.

It comes in a net, and it's loaded with a white cream.  The mask itself feels like alginate material, and has precut eyes, nose, and lips.  The nose was too long for me, so the upper lip portion just was all out of whack.  It took a while for me to adjust it so I could breath and so that I had adequate facial covering.  It's to be worn 30 minutes optimally.  It is very hydrating, and it rinses easily when time is up.

I always tend to use well known brands such as FHI, CHI, Sudo, etc.  However  the ease of use, functions and overall performance of the Ivation Professional Flat Iron has out performed and exceeded my expectations over my $200+ flat irons.

The touch sensitive controls are located inside the handles so no more accidentally turning the temperature down or annoying beeps because most digital displays have the controls outside where your fingers are constantly touching them.  To control the temperature and power, just lightly place your finger over the power icon or slide it up or down to control the temperature on the touch control panel.

It is truly amazing how quickly it heats up to your desired temperature.  You can watch the blue LED screen rapidly count up from 76 to 450 degrees in less than one minute.  This flat iron will glide over your hair like silk. It will leave you hair silky smooth and full of shine. Tourmaline ceramic plates produces far infra-red heat to release negative ions which reduces static and helps seal the cuticle to make your hair smoother and shiner. Tourmaline flat irons are highly recommended if you have really curly or frizzy hair.  Of course, even though using tourmaline ceramic plates can protect hair from high heat damage and breakage, you should always use a heat protection spray or product in your hair before flat ironing.

Comes with a VERY long 9 foot swivel cord.  It is extremely lightweight.

Automatically turns off if left unattended for 30 minutes.

Comes with a one-year warranty.

5.0,AEC90GPFKLAAW,B00NO3KZMS,"With two daughters, we've owned our share of curling and flat irons, almost all bought from Walmart or some other discount type store.  They did a decent job but usually died in a year or so - and one memorable Conair straightener caught on fire (luckily without anyone's hair in it!).  When I had an opportunity to try this Ivation professional-grade flat iron I wondered how it would differ from the ""civilian"" ones.

I'm happy to report that this flat iron really is better!  The ceramic plates slide effortlessly through my daughters' hair, without leaving a tortured, ironed look to it.  They had shiny, bouncy hair without any crimp marks or damage, and they could even make flips and curls by using this iron.  The actual plates are attached with a pivot, so they ""give"" a little as you use them.  I'm not up to speed on what infra-red and negative ionic energy does for hair, but my daughters assured me it takes away frizzies and adds the shine I mentioned above.

The iron heated up extra quickly, and we were all impressed by the digital-slider adjustment for the temperature.  The 9 foot cord with a swivel puts an end to tangled cords and standing near an outlet, and the auto-shutoff will never leave you wondering if you left something turned on at home.

I expected this to cost at least $60, but the price is not much more than a Conair or other brand we've tried.  Overall this is a very well made and useful flat iron, and I might even be tempted to let the girls tackle my curls and give it a try.

I received a black Ivation Professional Flat Iron (it comes in several colors) for testing and review purposes.

5.0,A3E8R7PQJYY8X3,B00NT0AR7E,"Anytime I can try a product from OZNaturals, I do. The Anti Aging Retinol Serum is the latest product I am trying and have incorporated it into my nightly regimen. I wash my face, use toner and then use the Serum. All of the facial products are easy to use, you don't need a lot and they absorb easily. There is just a barely there scent, not perfumy, but not chemically either. My skin gets a bit dry here in Northern Wisconsin so having something that works on my skin is great. Plus my face is 63 years old so I really need a product that not only helps with the dryness but the wrinkles too. I really don't have any wrinkles on my face so I am lucky there, I want to keep them at bay for as long as possible!
I like this product! Oh yes, you only need one tiny pump so this serum will last a long time!

I use it one day a week - usually the day after I have given myself a facial.  the day I let my face breath.  However I do need to apply a light face oil to my face and than a light moisturizer to add back moisture.

5.0,AI8DDPX23JCV2,B00NT0AR7E,"I started using retinol products (other than this one) about a year ago after reading so many reports about the benefits of Vitamin A (in the form of retinol) for aging skin (or skin in general).  It certainly made a difference to my face and has kept my skin youthful.

Overall I really like this retinol serum for a few reasons.  I have used retinol creams before and I don't always want a cream.  I like that this is a serum - so I like that can get the benefits of retinol without having to put on a heavy cream.  Also it's lightweight and dries quickly, making it easy to use.

I love that this is in a airless pump bottle (which I will definitely be refilling when it's empty) because it keeps the lotion bacteria free.  I think that small, often overlooked, aspect of this type of packaging truly helps my skin stay clear.  Using face lotions in airless pumps prevents growth of bacteria inside your face products and thus minimizes the amount of bacteria that goes on your skin when you apply them.  This is why I like to transfer my serums into airless pump bottles as well as my liquid foundations etc.

Some words of advice when purchasing retinol creams/serums.  Make sure it actually contains RETINOL.  Some retinol creams/serums that say ""retinol"" on the front of the bottle actually contain a derivative of vitamin A that is less effective (for your skin) and cheaper (for the manufacturer), which is retinyl palmitate.  Make sure if a bottle says it's retinol, that the ingredient list says retinol, like this product.

5.0,A3E8R7PQJYY8X3,B00NT0AR7E,"I have reviewed several products from Oz Naturals now and find their products to be very good. This Retinol Serum is an intense wrinkle correcting cream that will give you dramatic results. Great for even sensitive skin. Astaxanthin has been shown to help improve skin moisture levels, elasticity, and smoothness while reducing wrinkles, freckles, and spots.

I have been using it nightly and I think I need a longer time to use it, so I will continue my nightly regimen to include Oz Naturals 2.5% Retinol Serum with Astaxanthin as it takes a lifetime to achieve wrinkles and other skin imperfections it will most likely take time to see dramatic results.

Out with the Clinique, even out with the blue bottles, it must all go.  Now here is another product that is better than any of the Clinique products I depended on and at a fraction of the cost.

This is a retinol serum.  I use it on my clean skin before I put moisturizer on in the morning and at night.  .  I think that it multiplies the effect of a moisturizer by making it easier to absorb.  After six weeks of using this, my skin has a better texture and feels softer.  I don't see the finer lines on my skin.

I have always been careful to use quality products on my face for the past thirty years and this is one of the best lines of products.  These are products that are the same quality, but at a much lower price.  It's just amazing.

4.0,AJ9ZYMEUY14AX,B00O1DY34G,"This fun cheetah style detangling brush does the job of detangling without pain in a little bit longer than a regular brush.

Firstly, this brush is slightly smaller than a standard paddle brush. It has bristles both small and long that are plastic and have a flat head. The brush handle is about 3-4 inches and easy to hold. The wording on the bristle side of the brush rubbed off after one use, but the color on the back of the brush (the cheetah print pattern) stays put.

When brushing through the hair, there is absolutely zero pain to the noggin even through tangles. I am able to use this on my one-year-old with curly hair to the middle of her back. I have straight hair all the way down to my hips that gets tangled like no other. This brush glides through tangles after a few repeated swipes with no pain whatsoever. There is no pulling feeling on the hair. The only hair that falls out is the hair that was naturally about to shed. It reduces my hair loss when compared to a regular brush by about 3/4!

The only negative to this brush is that it takes about 2-3x the standard amount of time I use to take using my other brush.  I need to repeatedly swipe certain areas to get out the tangles. In comparison, although my standard brush would take less time, it would be painful and make me lose more hair.

3.0,A3TWPW6C78JPGV,B00O4KVVCI,"The headbands I received are NOT like the ones in the product image.  The product images (and some reviews) show 6 different colors, and a cotton-like fabric, but what I received was 4 different colors (2 grey, 2 brown, 1 navy, 1 black) made from shiny spandex swimsuit fabric. To make matters worse, none of them are stitched nicely, and I can see the glue that has oozed out under every HBY logo label.

I've attached some photos showing the hole on the underside of each band.  I understand that sometimes a hole is left in order to sew the seam and flip the whole thing inside out at the end, but in this case, ALL the stitching around ALL the holes on ALL 6 bands is loose and unraveling.  So there are literal and figurative loose ends here.

The headbands are comfortably roomy, so they make good hair accessories for washing your face and pushing your hair back.  But the lackluster workmanship, the cheap-feeling spandex fabric, and the fact that I didn't receive the diversity of colors that were advertised mean that I really can't give this more than 3 stars.

Its a subdued scent of freshly mown grass and it fades as soon as you apply it so it won't interfere with your perfume.  It disperses easily from the pump bottle and feels cool as you apply it under your eyes.  It blends in quickly and leaves no residue so it won't interfere with applying makeup.  Ive had trouble with other eye gels that make my eyes water but not with Beneleaf.

Helps with under eye puffiness but I didn't notice any huge difference in under eye wrinkles though it does smooth them somewhat.  Also the pump puts out more than Id like to use unless Im hyper careful to press lightly.  Its made in the US which gets huge points for me.

5.0,A1EVV74UQYVKRY,B00P6L1OXA,"I never knew about hair steaming but from what I've read about it is is more beneficial for really curly and especially black hair. The steam does a few things, it hydrates the hair but it also relaxes and lifts the cuticle so that products, like conditioners, can better penetrate. If you have longer hair, it's best to lift it up and pin it so it can benefit from the steam, especially the ends that tend to be them most damaged. This steamer is easy to set up (my 10-year old did it) and starts to work quickly. It is designed so that the steam is spread out around the hood and doesn't just shoot up to the top. I like that it has the ability to be a facial steamer as well because investing in this for just the hair steamer might be a stretch for some. Having both features is an added benefit.

4.0,A2W9I628I6SE1U,B00P6L1OXA,"This would be a 5-star review but for two things. 1) the attachements are at a fixed height. This means you have to either have a chair that can be raised or lowered, or you have to somehow move the entire unit so that it is placed just right. 2) the water reservior holds only enough water for about a 20 minute treatment, I think it could have been larger.

Negatives out of the way, I really like this ""spa at home"" device. A product like this is what some salons would use for either facial steaming or for hair treatments. The O3 (ozone) feature really puts this in the professional realm. You don't have to have it on, but it is there via a separate button. It is hard to judge, but O3 is supposed to help whatever treatment that has been applied to the hair 'soak in' more effectively. For the face, it just feels and smells good, especially if you add a drop or two of an essential oil like tea tree. Once you get the right height, the product is easy to use. You can fill it via the back dispenser or by removing the cup in the front. Afterwards, just wipe it all down after use and empty any remaining water. The warning tone when the session is over is a bit annoying, but just shut the unit off and it disappears. The Ivation 2-in-1 Tabletop Hair & Facial Steamer W/ozone is a great product for those who want the salon experience at home.

4.0,A2D1LPEUCTNT8X,B00P9QIHG4,"&nbsp;Until I tried my first bath bomb I was not quite sure why it was called a Bath Bomb... I took a video and you can see that it fizzes like an explosion.  The scent is light and pleasant.  Each bomb is a one time use product, the entire bomb fizzes away in about 1 minutes leaving the scented water infused with a moisturiser.  I now tried a couple of different bath bombs, some generate bubbles like bubble bath but SpaGlo bombs do not.  There is a bit of foaming as the bomb fizzes and then the foam quickly disappears. Overall a very pleasant and relaxing experience.

What can be better?  The packaging is pretty but the teal netting on the package is covered with sparkles which fall off and it takes quite a bit of work to clean them up.  Sparkles give a pretty effect, but I hate the extra clean up - sparkles stick to the floors and counters and it took cleaning with a wet cloth Swiffer to get them all.  I would have been happier with a plain teal netting. This is a 5 star product, but I did not like the packaging. Based on my experience if you open the package on a newspaper you can avoid the clean up.

I did not think I needed anything else for my baths. Turned out, I was wrong. I tried bath bombs because they were offered at a discount and was immediately hooked. Unlike bath salts, bath bombs moisturize your skin during bath and take your bath experience to the next level. But not all bath bombs are the same.

Spa Glo bath bombs are ones of the best. They moisturize the skin wonderfully due to their shea butter and cocoa butter content. They smell awesome!  I could not even pick which one I like the best, they are all great!  I usually do not care a lot for the visual effects of the bath bombs, like vivid colors and glitters but I realize that for other people these might be important. The packaging of Spa Glo bath bomb sets are the prettiest that I have seen. I just love the handmade glittered tulle bow with a sparkly heart. My severely autistic son who does not play with toys quickly got the hold of them from both Spa Glo sets, pink and blue. And the sets were wrapped in a pretty tissue paper.

After doing that, it warmed up quickly and stayed warm for many hours later. I know that when I checked 6 hours later, they were still warm.

I also found that I could use these similar to a hot water bottle. If one of my kids was cold or was feeling sick, I would just give him one of these hand warmers. He would then put it up against his body in bed and he seemed to really like that extra comfort.

5.0,AEC90GPFKLAAW,B00Q794RMA,"I've never used magnesium in a spray before I received this complimentary sample of Seven Minerals Magnesium oil (for review purposes). Lack of magnesium can cause muscle cramps and heart palpitations, menstrual cramps, restless legs and constipation (Milk of Magnesia is an anti-constipation medicine). It's most common in people who do a lot of sports or sweat a lot from working outdoors, but as much as 80% of people are low in magnesium. Magnesium is found naturally in green leafy vegetables, cashew nuts and pumpkin seeds, and some legumes like black beans, but many people don't eat enough of these foods to get sufficient magnesium.

Magnesium ""oil"", which is not really an oil (it's magnesium chloride), is found in brine harvested from ancient sea beds, and can be absorbed through the skin. It's more easily absorbed by our bodies this way than through taking an oral supplement. I've used Seven Minerals Magnesium oil for about a week now, and as with many vitamin and mineral supplements it's hard to say it's definitely working. I spray it on my feet and let it dry before I go to bed. I don't notice the itching some reviews have noted, but I have noticed that my restless/twitchy legs have been better since I started using it. The aloe vera added to this product soothes the skin and helps counteract the salt, although I also use a moisturizer on my feet after the spray has dried.

I believe this is a convenient and effective way to add magnesium to your body, and people with more severe cramping issues could find some relief from it. Because my diet is pretty balanced already, I didn't see huge benefits but I do feel it helped with my restless legs at night.",An easy and effective way to increase your magnesium,12oz Magnesium Oil with ALOE VERA - LESS ITCHY - Made in USA - Get Healthy Hair &amp; Skin and Sleep Better! || FREE eBook Included (New)

4.0,A1QBOC76MIOJYP,B00QHX7NT0,"I love all the Bliss Fatgirlslim products I have ever bought or tried. Fatgirlsleep is by far my fave product of the line and one of my most favorite body products, period - it is the best. This product here, Hide and Glow Sleek is ok. As a self tanner, it is a great product. it goes on surprisingly even, dries super fast and has no scent at all that I could smell. It reminds me of a light airbrush spray, so it is very easy to work with and get nice, even color. I am very pale and I got the medium to deep shade and it does not look orange at all. I am sure if you spray it too heavily, too quickly, it might, but I ended up with  very nice color and not very dark at all - I didn't want anything too drastic. It gave me just the right amount of color to take away the paleness. I love self  tanning products since I am so fair skinned, but it is hard to find many that work well and not look fake or orange or too dark. It takes me awhile to build up a natural tan, so I always start the season with self tanners. As just a tanner, I like this one since the color is nice, even, and you don't even have to use your hands to apply it. You could just spray and go.

The directions state to spray even strokes down the leg, but I didn't really go in straight lines like that. It is a very fine spray, so it applies very nicely and lightly, so you can build up the color if you want. Once I spray an area, I kinda give it a once over with my hand to smooth and/or blend it and it already feels dry and doesn't even need any blending. It has a very faint shimmer to it, which is what helps the ""sleek"" effect. The light reflects off those particles and helps to hide imperfections - like an optical illusion. I am not one for shimmery or glittery body products, but this is very minimal and I don't mind it at all.

As for the firming aspect, I don't think it is as good as the original Fatgirlslim cream or Fatgirlsleep (sleep version is fabulous, im telling you!) but it does make your skin feel smooth. I don't think it has the tightening effect that the creams do. It may be hard to deliver in a spray like this, especially if you use it lightly. Overall, though, I do like it and I will continue to use it. If I notice any further tightening effects as more time passes, I will update my review. With the Bliss creams, it is immediate so I expected the same with this spray.

As a tanner, I'd give it 5 stars
As a slimming/tightening/firming product, I'd give it 3 to 4-ish stars so far. The effects of the shimmer reducing the appearance of cellulite and dimples allows for the rating to be closer to 4 stars.

If you really want to feel your skin tighter and lose the appearance of dimples, try Fatgirlslim or Fatgirlsleep. Your skin will say thank you!!","Very nice tanner, ""so-so"" firming, excellent masking.",bliss Fabgirlslim Hide and Go Sleek Tinted Body Spray
5.0,A29VG90T649CSU,B00QHX7NT0,"Never having used a tinted body spray/product before, I was not sure what to expect. Well, maybe I actually did expect the worse. A formula that didn't dry quickly, stained my clothing, and turned me orange is what I was fearing. However, this spray has me pleasantly surprised. The spray is lightweight and dries quickly upon application. I have fair skin and the fair to medium glow gave me just a little color (which I appreciated) and did help to even out my skin tone (it helped to diminish the darker areas from previous exposure to the sun and also age spots). The spray also has an extremely light scent; you can barely tell it is there, even directly after applying the product. This is good for my sensitive skin, and also, for those who use them, will not clash with cologne and other scented body products. And, it did not rub off onto my clothing, either.

I seem to be in the minority as far as my rating for this product, but I have to base my review on my own personal experience. Some other reviews have mentioned using a less expensive product, such as Jergens. I cannot use almost all of the Jergens skincare products, as they cause severe dermatitis, which ends up in a trip to the doctor's office (I am not talking mild irritation, here). I do not think the price for this product is exorbitant, either.  If you plan on using this product daily, then I suppose it could get expensive. For myself, I will use this spray occasionally, when I want my entire body (and not just my face) to benefit from a little glow and a little color, especially during the warmer weather. I also believe you get what you pay for. As I already stated, this tinted body spray does not aggravate my allergy prone skin, and I am sure that is probably due to better ingredients in a higher quality product. I think this spray is good value for the money, and would definitely purchase it for myself or another member of my family (and, yes, the skin sensitivity is hereditary and runs in my family).","Pleasantly Surprised, Nice Body Tint Spray!",bliss Fabgirlslim Hide and Go Sleek Tinted Body Spray
2.0,A3THYM7XMB8B0U,B00QHX7NT0,"I have to agree with previous posters about the smell/spray/aerosol thing. I've used tanning lotions and while I have often bemoaned the streaky look sometimes left behind, I actually prefer that method of application. This is some strong stuff and I wondered what I was breathing. Spraying this in the bathroom resulted in a coughing fit. It's as bad as hairspray--okay, worse.

The color is super subtle. I'm not sure I'm actually seeing any tint at all or just imagining it because I expect it to be there.

It does not do anything as far as making me look slimmer or hiding stretch marks or anything like that.

4.0,AW7BIYHXUIZ62,B00QHX7NT0,"I'm reviewing ""medium to deep glow"" shade, trying it out on some really pasty white legs.

Sprays on easily with a very handy 360 spray can that works from all angles including upside down.  Nice light feel.  No offensive scent.  Results?

On those oh-so-white legs, I was disappointed to see a hint of orange.  This is an important negative, BUT, I'm thinking the major problem here (regarding the orange hue) is that I was applying the medium/deep tinted product on very white skin.  I think I would have got more desirable results with the ""light to medium"" tint.  (Save ""the medium to deep glow"" shade for skin with already some color).  Realistically, I was just looking for enough color so as not to be embarrassed, I really wasn't trying for a well-tanned look.  The application did leave a nice sheen that looked reasonably healthy, and not flashy or ridiculous.  The glow combined with the color does indeed help camouflage pale and dimpled skin.  As I said, if you are working on pasty white areas, go with the lighter shade selection.  Hangs in there a couple of days, but will shower off.

Now, about the ""firming"" aspect. Felt great going on - nice and light.  I can imagine, I suppose,  some sensation of firming.  But even the manufacturer suggests, ""For best firming results, use every day . . . in conjunction with regular exercise, a healthy diet . . ."" (you get the picture).

An easy- to-use product that does give immediate, though temporary results - leaving a nice more healthy look.  You'll have to pay attention to shade selection, and application technique.","Not a miracle, but one of the better instant tanners",bliss Fabgirlslim Hide and Go Sleek Tinted Body Spray

5.0,A1BRCVMQ7C9CGJ,B00RAMAHA4,"This comes in a large container. It was a lot larger than I was expecting. It works well. It is a little hard to get out because of its tackiness and hardness. However, you just push your finger in and scrape some up and you will have it. You do not need to use much for most styles, depending on what type of style you're going for. I rub a little bit of this cream in between my fingertips and then rub it into the area of my hair that I want. It holds very well. I used this on my son's hair when he wanted a particular style. It turned out quite well. This is not sticky or greasy at all. It also does not get stiff. It looks and feels natural. It has a nice scent for men. My son likes it a lot and he uses it most days. I used it a couple times too. The scent is not strong or noticeable.

I like how natural your hair looks after using this. It does not leave your hair shiny or greasy. It looks very natural, as if you used nothing at all. Remember not to grab too much. However, if a little bit doesn't seem like enough for your particular hairstyle, then you can always grab some more. Rub it into your palms or fingertips first before applying it. I have bought the professional hair salon pomades and hair creams before. This works just as well as any of those, maybe even better since it's non-greasy and looks natural. Furthermore, this package is a lot bigger than what you usually get in the hair salons. So I think you definitely get your money's worth from this. I was so glad to be able to buy this product while they had a promotion going on. I think this is a great cream for getting that particular look or definition you want. They give you plenty of it too. This is well worth your money. In addition, it does not leave any white flakes in your hair. I have experienced that from other products. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.

Ps.  If this product is too solid or hard for you to use, just add a teaspoon of water and mix. You may want to let it sit with the water overnight to help soften it up.

4.0,A19KLUZ1XD3SRN,B00RCJU6Q0,"In the years that I've worried about cellulite, I've been told that it's a problem that doesn't have a real lasting fix.  But this doesn't keep me from trying different possible products that might help even if they don't fully rid ""solve"" or eliminate cellulite altogether.  It's in this spirit that I tried out Dr Brandt's Cellusculpt.

The cream comes in secure packaging, carefully sealed to prevent it from spilling during transit. With product this expensive, it's good to know that it will arrive in good condition.  You only need a little bit of cream at a time, so I expect that the tube should last me several months with careful application.  I've been applying a pea size for each troublespot (each thigh and the backside).  It leaves a slightly cooling and tingly feeling which lasts for a bit.  I found that it makes me more conscious of the area as well, encouraging me to do more spot exercises, which is a good thing.  I haven't noticed any significant reduction in the cellulite in the week that I've used it. It compares well to the Estee Lauder Body Performance Slim Shape Anti-Cellulite Visible Contouring Cream that I'd used in the past.

Brandt Celluscript could remove the cellulite from the backs of my thighs. I always hope for a miracle. It would be great if I could just apply a cream and the cellulite would just dissolve away and my thighs would look like they belonged to a twenty-something instead of those of a woman whose age is an unlisted number. Well, this cream went on easily and the applicator with the little round bearings in the top that roll over the skin while dispensing the cream are kind of unique. And the cream has sort of a medicinal fragrance which smells like serious stuff for cellulite melting. But even after using it a couple times per day, not a lot of improvement is seen. It does act as a good moisturizer, so my skin is a little smoother. But my thighs aren't sculpted or smaller in any way and the cellulite is still there.

I so far have not seen a difference in cellulite, and I've used it correctly.  The tube, in the open position has a center top opening to squeeze out the product.  The metal rollerballs around the center are for reshaping your fat cells.

I personally wasn't sure of the smell, but my husband said I smelled musky in a good way.  He said I smelled nice.

Just a little product goes a long way.  I might buy this again.  I have eczema, and this product goes right into your skin and won't rub off like emollients.

Maybe I'm just a difficult case, being 60 and overweight.  It is a bit jiggly and awkward going on certain spots.  But is is an overall good product in my opinion.

After 4 weeks it is said on the box that:
96% reported skin texture improvement. - check
96% reported skin was more toned and firmer - check

4.0,A1BRCVMQ7C9CGJ,B00S8JQKEA,"This is easy to apply and use. It takes a little longer because of the two products you need to apply and the extra steps to achieve the look you want, though. The first step is some sort of mascara gel. You have to use that step before you can use the second step. You have to apply the second tube, which are the fibers immediately after using the first tube. You then can do all the steps over again to get more fibers to stick to your eyelashes. The fiber tube is dry so you must apply it quickly after applying the mascara gel. Do one eye completely before doing the second eye. I wish this came with a dry eyelash brush for when I am completely done with all the steps. My eyelashes started to clump but if you have, an eyelash brush than you can fix that problem and your eyelashes will look beautiful.

I have never tried any sort of fiber mascara before so I was thrilled to buy this at a discount. It comes with good instructions, which I really appreciated. The instructions say you can apply your regular mascara first, if you want too, so I tried that. I liked the results better this way. I also could then see the added length from the fibers. The fibers do seem to fall down onto your face as the day goes on though. You will get little flexes but they are so tiny it really wasn't a big deal to me. I wish the fibers were not so dry though but I guess that is why it comes with a gel that you're supposed to apply first.  I love the packaging and the box this comes in. It's so cute and it feels like the box has a magnet closure, which is really nice.

I have been regularly using it, in conjunction with a regular exercise routine and a low carb diet. The results that I have observed from using this product truly impressed me.

This product has been a tremendous help to me and I have noticed that my arms are becoming firmer and the dimples at the back of my thighs are becoming less pronounced. It also has quality, all natural ingredients that I appreciate because I have very sensitive skin.

I HAVENT SEEN THAT UNGREDIENT IN OTHER VITAMIN C SERUMS THAT I HAVE TRIED.

IVE BEEN SEEING LOTS OF ARTICLES AND POSTS ON VITAMIN C SERUMS AND CREAMS IN MAGAZINE ARTICLES, ON LINE, ON TELEVISION, AND ON BLOGS, SO I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY AND IM ABSOLUTELY AMAZED WITH THE RESULTS THAT I AM STARTING TO EXPeRIENCE!!

AT THIS POINT IVE TRIED 6 DIFFERENT TOPICAL VITAMIN C'S, THIS BEING MY SIXTH, VITAMIN C PRODUCT, AND FOURTH THAT IS A SERUM AND NOT A CREAM.

I HAVE A REALLY BIG BELLY BUTTON SCAR FROM MY TUBLIGATION, AND THIS IS THE THIRD SERUM THAT I TRIED ON IT. I AM ON DAY 9 OF USING THIS VITAMIN C PRODUCT,. THIS IS WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH THE PREVIOUS VITAMIN C SERUMS AND WIlllWITH THIS ONE TOO AS I AM ALREADY NOTICING A CHANGE ON DAY 3. FIRST, I STARTED OFF USING THE SERUM ONLY ONCE A DAY TO SEE IF I ACTUALLY SEE RESULTS, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT AGREES WITH MY SKIN AS WELL. AFTER 3 DAYS OF USING IT MY SCAR HAD NOTICABLY LIGHTENED UP AND I HAD NO TROUBLE USING IT, SO I INCREASED MY DAILY USAGE UP TO TWO TIMES A DAY, I WOULD APPLY IT IN THE MORNING BEFORE GETTING DRESSED AND AGAIN AT NIGHT BEFORE BED. I HAVE 5 CHILDREN, SO I DO NOT HAVE A SET SHOWERING SCHEDULE, I THROW ONE IN WHEN I CAN, SO OBVIOUSLY WEATHER IT WAS MORNING OR NIGHT I APPLIED THE VITAMIN C AFTER MY SHOWER.

I have been using it for several months, and Im lazy so I cant say I used it every night but when I did manage to give my skin a spa ending I would always run this along my top lashes and through my brows. Interestingly enough I found that this made my lashes grow longer, I could really see the difference when applying mascara ( LOreal Telescopic ) and they would be much longer than usually, especially in the center of my eye, it also helped with some broken ones I had on my right eye towards the outer edge from a cheap curler, which chopped them off. That happened to me more than once, and it took months to grow them back, before it took so long I stopped hoping but this serum seemed to make that time a lot shorter and made me realize how different parts of my lash line are vulnerable from makeup tools.

It stings a little if you let it get into your eye through careless application, so go easy but so far Im really enjoying it, and it feels natural, not chemical, when its on my skin its almost like water and feels fresh. I believe apple has been used in this, to stimulate the growth and its made in the USA.  This might not work on everyone, since nothing ever does but I had great results, count me as a happy camper  :)

Do they work? YES!
Do they last? NO!

Except for this one. It has outperformed the others.
First, a bit about these brushes. They come in a number of shapes and paddles, but are similar in that they have the same kind of plastic bristles.
The bristles stagger in length, and painlessly smooth knots and tangles.
Most of the time the bristles start to bend and then the brush is useless. After months of hard use, this one is still good as new.

These are a favorite with parents of kids with unruly hair, because they don't hurt.
I like it for myself, and it's also my 'secret weapon'.

One of my favorite products to test out (besides masks of course) is hand cream!  I cannot even tell you how many hand creams I have tested over the years.  I'm fairly picky about my hand creams, however, I also like a variety of hand creams to choose from.  Sometimes I want a light hand cream that absorbs quickly and other times I want a nice and thick hand cream that will just sit and kind of marinate on my hands and then eventually soak in.  I also like a hand cream that falls somewhere in between.  Where I am and what I am doing always influences what kind of hand cream I use.
This Hand Cream by LeiaSea has been my one and only ""go-to"" Hand Cream for several weeks now!  Which is kind of amazing since I have about 5 different ones that I use on an everyday basis.  It just provides the perfect amount moisture to my overly dry hands without feeling greasy and also leaves them feeling incredibly soft and silky.  I also really like the light, fresh scent and a little goes a long way so that is a bonus too!  I've also been using it on my feet and it has really helped soothe and heal my dry, cracked heels.  The Leliasea Hand Cream definitely gets a 5-Star rating from me!

4.0,AT53ZTTO707MB,B00W259T7G,"I have another brand of bar soap with a much more potent patchouli fragrance.  I had hoped that I would be able to bury my nose in this bar from Pre de Provence and imagine that I had just opened a bottle of patchouli essential oil.  No, no, it did not happen.  While it is a lovely fragrance, it is somewhat meek and mild.  Maybe that is what you are looking for, but I wanted deep, true, powerful patchouli.

With this bar from Pre de Provence I do get rich, smoothing and soothing moisturizing.  It was opportune that I had recently purchased two bars of soap from Plantlife, patchouli and sandalwood.  Oh, my!  Those fragrances are potent and wonderful!  Way more so than those from Pre de Provence.  Having the two patchouli bars at the same time allowed me to see the moisturizing qualities of both soaps.  The Plantlife dried my skin.  This Pre de Provence always left my skin soft and supple.  It was a BIG difference; so easy to see when I had the two together.

So, when it comes to the patchouli and the sandalwood soaps, which one you would like better depends on what you are looking for in a soap:  True potent fragrance or moisturizing luxury.  For me it boils down to my skin's needs in the cooler, drier months, and that means I go with the Pre de Provence.

If you do want to try the Plantlife patchouli, this is it:&nbsp;Patchouli 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g).  Maybe you might be interested in an Italian bar soap put out by Pre de Provence.  It has a mix of patchouli and rosewood and bergamot:&nbsp;Via Mercato Italian Soap Bar (200g), No. 1 - Patchouli and Rosewood.  It has a lovely, intriguing and subtle fragrance.

A word on the size of this bar:  I have long fingers, so this large 250g size is not awkward in my hand.  But I can easily see that it might be a problem for smaller hands.  There is patchouli in the 200g size, but not the 150g.  Here is the link:&nbsp;Pre de Provence Shea Butter Enriched Artisanal French Soap Bar (200 g), Traditional Fragrance - Patchouli.","I hoped for a more potent patchouli scent, unfortunately it's not there.

4.0,AT53ZTTO707MB,B00W259T7G,"I love Pre de Provence bar soaps, and I love sandalwood.  By reading lots of reviews, I notice that many people do not like potent scents, and prefer light, delicate or unobtrusive fragrances.  I am not one of them.  I don't particularly like heavy, sweet and cloying scents, but I do love to breathe in intense, true fragrances.  (I say all this not to disrespect those who like unscented or light scents, but to let you know where my rating is coming from.)

I wanted to take a deep breath with my nose right up on this large bar of sandalwood and be able to say, ""Ahhh, sandalwood!""  No, that did not happen.  Yes, the sandalwood fragrance is there, but there are other scents as well, and together, it all gentles down the sandalwood.  It is a lovely soap, but not the sandalwood fragrance I was hoping for.

I have a bar of Plantlife Sandalwood soap that I bought about six weeks ago,&nbsp;Sandalwood 100% Pure & Natural Aromatherapy Herbal Soap- 4 oz (113g).  It has way more sandalwood fragrance than this Pre de Provence.  But, interestingly, I noticed something when I traded that bar for the Pre de Provence:  While the Plantlife has the fragrance, Pre de Provence has the moisturizers.  When using the Pre de Provence, I definitely noticed that my legs, feet, arms, hands were not dry.  As soon as I went back to the Plantlife--just one day--that soap dried out my skin.

So, depends on what you are looking for in your soap.  If you want the intense fragrance, choose Plantlife, and give up soft and smooth skin.  I found both to give great lather, but only the Pre de Provence gave moisture.

A word about the size of this 250g bar:  If you have long fingers or large hands, you will be able to grasp this bar easily.

5.0,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B00W259T7G,"This is an average-sized bar of scented French-milled, French-made soap designed to over a more luxurious experience than consumer-grade soaps. I will be comparing this both in use and in price to average body bars, but my rating takes into the account that this is a premium product which offers certain benefits that you cannot get from products like basic Ivory soap or Kirkland's body bar. This gets extra points for those added qualities.

I will note the price differences first. This is a 150-gram bar for a little under $5 whereas a 130-gram bar of Kirkland signature will cost you an average of 66 cents. Both bars will get you equally clean, but that is really the only point where the products overlap. Besides the truly lovely rose scent of this bar (it smells like a real rose  mild and not too overbearing, but present), it has a much better feel. The lather is creamier and feels silkier on the skin. One point about it that I was really happy about was that it wasn't so perfumey that I walked out of the shower smelling as if I'd applied a scent to my skin. This was more of an enjoyable transient experience in which I enjoyed the scent while I was using it, but didn't subject others to it once I was out of the bath. In my case, my husband is super sensitive to perfume-like smells so this worked for me. If you're looking for something longer lasting, this may not be what you're after.

In terms of how it leaves my skin, this is absolutely better for not drying my skin out. I'm guessing that this is the shea butter replenishing to some extent what oils the soap is stripping off when you use the soap. I wouldn't say that you don't need an added moisturizer after using it (at least I still needed moisturizer), but it's definitely gentler than other bars that I've used.

The bar is very hard or solid in a way that consumer-grade bars are not. This is because of the quad-milling that is advertised on the product page. I had not heard about this process before trying this soap, but it reduces the water content of the bars and makes them last longer. I will note that my average bar of soap will tend to melt in the shower and there are little stalactites of soap residue on my soap dish on my shower caddy where the soap has dissolved and the residue has drained off and hardened (which represents a loss of soap/value). This soap doesn't do that. It dries harder and firmer and doesn't melt away at the edges. That means that it lasts a lot longer. I can't do a scientific test or anything, but my best guess is that I got 3x the mileage out of this bar than the Kirkland bars that I usually use (and possibly 4x the use compared to Ivory, which I find melts away much more rapidly than any other soap). This is still a more expensive soap on average than consumer-grade brands, but it isn't quite as expensive as it seems when you factor in longevity and the quality of experience is rather markedly better in terms of the feel and the scent.","lasts longer than mass-mproduced consumer soaps, natural scent","Pre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry"
5.0,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B00W259T7G,"Pr de Provence is known for the large blocks of savon de Marseille made with olive oil that are especially suited for use in the kitchen, but these newer artisanal bars are easier to handle.  They are made with vegetable oil only, no animal fat, and are quadruple-milled to last a long time.  They contain glycerin and shea butter as moisturizers, so that they don't dry out the skin as much as some soaps do.

The variety of fragrances is impressive, and they all smell so nice that its hard to decide on a favorite.  Agrumes (citrus) smells distinctly of grapefruit with lemony notes and the verbena smells as fresh as if you had just plucked a leaf from the bush and crushed it in your hand.  The almond, pomegranate, and mirabelle (plum) will make your mouth water.  The florals such as violette and angels trumpet are a pleasant change from  offensive artificial floral scents.

It has a light scent of maybe citronella or lemon balm, which is very fresh and clean smelling.  The bar itself is huge (8.8 ounces) and rectangular, not like the rounded, concave, 3 ounce bar soaps we find at the store!  It lathers up quickly and produces a thick foamy lather that cleans well.  It also contains shea butter for moisturizing, although it rinses cleanly without any oily residue.

The bars are ""quad milled"" (processed four times) which makes them slow to dissolve, so one bar will last for several months with daily use.  I especially like that this soap doesn't contain parabens or sodium lauryl sulphate, both of which are linked to health issues.  I've made soap myself several times and know that soap doesn't have to have tons of chemicals to work well.

My skin visually appears more moisturized when I use this  soap (compared to the brand that was previously in my shower). I still required lotion but could have skipped it without feeling dry and itchy.

 Linden smells like an ultra-mild lily-of-the-valley fragrance.  Peony smells... like a peony (assumption as I've never sniffed one before). I don't like the way that Angel's Trumpet smells.  It doesn't impact my rating... this just isn't the fragrance for me. I don't dislike it enough to let it go to waste so this isn't a deal breaker.

When using this soap the fragrance is stronger in the air than on my skin. It creates a relaxing experience without leaving the skin heavily perfumed.

The color of the soap is a bright green-yellow. More yellow. Peony is a soft blush/shell pink. Angel Trumpet is a yellow-beige that my kids describe as r sandy-yellow. There is a marbled like consistency to this barbiturates am overall smooth feel.  The bars have a 12/2019 expiration date on them.a

Using the soap for showering, I have found that the surface has a texture created by the pomegranate specks. This makes it easier to grip. Also, I like the way that it feels on my skin.

The speckled pink color and imprinted Pre de Provence logo also makes for a very attractive presentation on the sink or in the bath.  Obviously, all of this makes one anxious to finally bathe with it - and it doesn't disappoint.

A smooth creamy feel.  Those little speckles are hard particles that will provide a stimulating scrubbing and exfoliating action against the skin.  Mild lather.  It does burn if you get it in your eyes.  As expected, the smell is pleasant and bold and makes bathing a treat.  Rinsing seems to take more than average effort, as this soap is rich and tends to want to hang around.  After toweling my skin was literally squeaky clean, if you can appreciate that analogy.  An hour after drying . . . skin (including my face) was no longer ""squeaky"", but clearly felt moisturized and soft.  The scent lingered mildly, not so much pomegranate, but rather a clean soapy scent.

This is a fine, luxurious soap.  The experience with it is much different than using even the better regarded mainstream American store shelf soaps.

My bar of soap weighs just under 6 ounces.  It's over an inch thick and 3.5 inches long.  Good sized bar of soap.  Mine is mint green with brown flecks.  I am reminded of mint chocolate chip ice cream. It's Rosemary mint.  I love mint soaps, shampoos, and lotions.  The mint is a great eye opener and invigorates tired bones.

The soap lathers up nicely and rinses off well.  I feel no residue.  It looks great in my bathroom.  I would buy this soap if I saw it in the store.

The soap itself is smooth and lathers pretty well. It is very soft, feels nice on the skin and does actually clean you off. I found that I needed to rinse a little more than usual to get the last residue of it off though.

This is the first bar of ""Peony"" I've tried and it's very good. Given the name, it's no surprise it's a floral scent; I'd say it leans more feminine than masculine, but I'd also say its unisex if you like soft florals.

5.0,A2R1HUYHXV7H18,B00W259T7G,"This review is for the green tea scented shea butter soap.

This soap is a nice thick bar that's easy to hold.  It arrived a bit soft, as if it didn't have a long cure, but that could be from a higher shea butter content, as really high content shea butter tends to be soft like that. In any event, I didn't feel like sitting it around to attempt to dry it out further, I wanted to use it!  (So I did!)  It smells of green tea but it is not a very strong scent.  It's attractive, olive green and has the Pre de Provence logo etched into the bar.  It came plainly wrapped in cellophane.

It lathers very well.  If you work it, it develops into a creamy foam - another reason I suspect the shea butter content is high.  It leaves skin very clean and with a green tea scent that clings lightly- for hours if I'm not that active.  My husband and son also like it.

The green tea scent is like the smell I'd experience smelling a cup of brewed green tea, it is NOT as sharp as the famous perfume by that name, and it is much more subtle, and natural smelling than that.

This is a soap that you need to allow to dry well after use, because it is soft, and it will degrade if left in a wet area for too long.","The green tea scent is very natural, not like perfume, and it clings lightly to the skin for a while","Pre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry"

I've been a fan for years.  Pre de Provence has greatly expanded their line over the past few years, and more and more of them are showing up on Amazon.  To have such wonderful French products available here at the touch of my computer screen is a real treat!
This line of soaps with Shea butter is especially comforting and gratifying.  I tried the lavender fragrance in this line and it is very fragrant.  It is floral and spicy and not cloyingly sweet.  It is a sophisticated fragrance, and it is potent and true lavender.  Just lovely!

The shea butter in this bar seems to make the lather glide smoothly across my skin.  It washes off well, yet seems to leave a softness behind that clings to my skin.  The little brownish pieces in the bar are actually pieces of petal.  I does not add any coarseness to the bar, and I think it may be included just to add to the ""artisanal"" look.  But maybe it works to hold essential oil, too.
The fragrance lasts only for an hour or two, and that is as it should be, I think.  It does not interfere with the perfume I wear.  The lavender fragrance is mostly restricted to the bath.","A tried and true potent lavender fragrance, enhanced with enriching shea butter","Pre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry"

4.0,AF5AJ5V9T6LTS,B00W259T7G,"Pre de Provence offers some very good soaps with excellent fragrances, including this one - white gardenia.

The pluses are they are large and last a long time due to being milled (compressed) and the air bubbles take out rendering a very solid soap with heft. They have great smell and the aroma really matches a natural gardenia. They lather very well. All in all, they are very well made.

Now the small minus(es). These soaps contain small amounts of Tetrasodium EDTA & Tetrasodium Etidronate (as listed), which I developed an allergy to over the years and a small percentage of the population is like me. Therefore, if you are allergic to these chemicals, you should think twice or use modestly.",Very good scent and long lasting bar.,"Pre de Provence Artisanal French Soap Bar Enriched with Shea Butter, Quad-Milled For A Smooth &amp; Rich Lather (150 grams) - Raspberry"

In the milling process of soap making, the soap is literally shaved into thin strips then compressed by machine with high pressure to compact the resulting bar of soap. The result is a soap without air pockets and thus lasts longer and lathers better. This soap line has excellent natural scent, which is not overpowering. One bar lasts a very long time. This is also free of parabens, ethyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, and DEA.

This rose water facial toner is rather simple and as it is. Upon waking up from a nap, I suddenly had an urge to try the rose water that came in on the same day even though I was planning for another day.

There are total of 6 ingredients on the list;
- Aloe
- Rose (distilated)
- Glycerin
- Phenoxyethanol
- Tetrasodium EDTA

The toner is transparent in color just like water and smells like parfum. It does smell like rose however but not the way roses actually smell, therefore I think that they have added some sort of fragrance, etc. Not listed however.

As for my experience with the toner, I applied it on my face with the help of a piece of cotton which was on the directions. The toner felt very cool and refreshing on my face. I am rather neutral about the scent because it is not too strong if you apply just a little bit on your face with a piece of cotton or tissue is fine. It is very hot today, hitting almost 90 degrees ;<
There was no irritation or discomfort on my skin therefore I feel safe. I do have sensitive skin and I feel that this is a good facial toner for people with sensitive skin.
As for a moisturizer I did not feel the necessity to use one after using the toner. I feel that the toner is fine alone.",Very cool and refreshing.

When I received this product, I was hoping to see 100% rosewater only instead, it had different ingredients which are still safe to use on the skin but since I'm a regular rose water fan and use the 100%  percent Morrocan Rose Water ingredient which is Rosa Damascena, I was hesitant to try it because of all the other ingredients it contained.

I sprayed some on a cotton pad and pat it on my face and was able to lift some makeup residue and not break out or have any skin irritations. The scent is very beautiful and not too strong and I actually spritzed some on my hair for some fly always.
But I have to say the Elrique Naturals does the same thing at toning and hydrating and refreshing the skin like my other rose water bottles.

5.0,A2T0A3DUB6M3O2,B00WQAMF9G,"I received a discounted price for the oil to review. My review of the oil is 100% honest and my own.

I did a little research before I tested the emu oil. Here is a little background of the Emu bird;
They are native to Australia and they can grow to a large size - 6 feet in height. They cannot fly or walk backwards.
I have to admit that I feel bad using the oil after knowing what an Emu farm is. Raised and killed for their oil/meat. However this will not affect my review and rating for the oil.

The emu oil is not just for the hair and skin as moisturizer but it can be used to treat many chronic skin ailments;

- Rashes
- pain (muscle pain, back pain, legs, etc)
- sore feet
- blisters
- bug bites
- acne (due to anti-inflammatory properties)

The oil seem to be semi-transparent in color. It is a little cloudy with bubble like tissues? Perhaps is particles of fat? See picture 2 and 3.
The scent is extremely faint and you can hardly notice any. Nothing unpleasant.
The oil is non greasy and non oily. Very gently oil actually, almost like argan oil.
I applied just a dab bit on my hand and rubbed in a circular motion. It felt cool and moisturizing. No irritation or discomfort and no side-effect.
After about 3 minutes of drying, my skin felt very soft.

I feel that it is a waste to use it in hair because emu oil is very precious and quite expensive.

5.0,A1KHU669CBQ95Y,B00WQAMC8U,"at first i saw this and of course kind of made a face, every ones doing the rose hip seed oil but which quality is the better of them all was my question and why, which one was raw in its form and which one had this distinct smell of roses held to long, You see real rose hip seed oil has this almost mildew smell, other companies distill there's so the smell is actually gone, and over filter it, i have noticed two things when you do this.

1. it removes some of the actual properties used for healing hair and skin
2. it does change the original colour and scent

However this does not mean that it does not work, it does just not at the highest you would expect, it would take a lot more to do a little bit than less to do more which is what we are looking for. with that said Elrique Naturals has figured it out again.

Pros:
Healing properties are explained as healing skin and face blemishes, great for a skin cleanser for those with psoriasis like myself, excema, as well as blemishes to the skin from acne.

haircare when used on wet hair it gives a glossy sheen to it, remember a little goes a long way.

After shower treatment to keep your skin looking and feeling healthy all day.

great to mix in shea butter for a lip treatment or balm for every day use specially in the winter.

conditioning treatment added with an array of other oils (coconut, shea, jojoba, castor) can make this oil the perfect oil for treating dry and brittle ends or just to liven up your hair with a co wash before your shower, leave it on for at least an hour before you shampoo out.

Plastic brown bottle makes it easier to store and keep in a dark place, i wouldn't suggest a fridge since it will make the oil thicken but if your not worried about that go ahead and do that since it will only prolong the life of your oil.

easy dispense push down top, this top is a good idea, i would have liked one that you could close that a child wouldn't be able to squirt it all over the place, but since i do not have small children in my home, I do not have to worry about such things, i would suggest not keeping this at a level to where a child could eat it as roses in any form are good for the skin not internal organs.

Cons:

the distinct smell may be a huge turn off for some, but remember real organics do have strange smells so please don't let that be a turn off to great benefits. remember as they say nothing good  for you actually smells or tastes good

5.0,A27YBG8LOP3277,B00WQALWHM,"FIRST OFF, IVE TRIED QUITE A FEW VITAMIN C CREAMS AND SERUMS IN THE LAST MONTH OR SO, THEY ARE BECOMING VERY POPULAR, AND I LOVE THIS ONE FROM ELRIQUE NATURALS! I THINK THE LITTLE BIT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SERUMS IS THAT RHIS ONE HAS COQ10. I HAVENT SEEN THAT UNGREDIENT IN OTHER VITAMIN C SERUMS THAT I HAVE TRIED.

IVE BEEN SEEING LOTS OF ARTICLES AND POSTS ON VITAMIN C SERUMS AND CREAMS IN MAGAZINE ARTICLES, ON LINE, ON TELEVISION, AND ON BLOGS, SO I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A TRY AND IM ABSOLUTELY AMAZED WITH THE RESULTS THAT I GOT!

AT THIS POINT IVE TRIED 6 DIFFERENT TOPICAL VITAMIN C'S, THIS BEING MY SIXTH, VITAMIN C PRODUCT, AND FOURTH THAT IS A SERUM AND NOT A CREAM.

I HAVE A REALLY BIG BELLY BUTTON SCAR FROM MY TUBLIGATION, AND THIS IS THE THIRD SERUM THAT I TRIED ON IT. I AM ON DAY 9 OF USING THIS VITAMIN C PRODUCT,. THIS IS WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH THE PREVIOUS VITAMIN C SERUMS AND WILL DO WITH THIS ONE TOO AS I AM ALREADY NOTICING A CHANGE ON DAY 3. FIRST, I STARTED OFF USING THE SERUM ONLY ONCE A DAY TO SEE IF I ACTUALLY SEE RESULTS, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT AGREES WITH MY SKIN AS WELL. AFTER 3 DAYS OF USING IT MY SCAR HAD NOTICABLY LIGHTENED UP AND I HAD NO TROUBLE USING IT, SO I INCREASED MY DAILY USAGE UP TO TWO TIMES A DAY, I WOULD APPLY IT IN THE MORNING BEFORE GETTING DRESSED AND AGAIN AT NIGHT BEFORE BED. I HAVE 5 CHILDREN, SO I DO NOT HAVE A SET SHOWERING SCHEDULE, I THROW ONE IN WHEN I CAN, SO OBVIOUSLY WEATHER IT WAS MORNING OR NIGHT I APPLIED THE VITAMIN C AFTER MY SHOWER.

THIS ELRIQUE NATURALS VITAMIN C SERUM IS A CLEARISH LIKE IN COLOR SERUM AND HAS A THICKER SERUM TEXTURE. I LOVE THAT IT IS NOT COMPLETELY THIN LIKE WATER. I DO WISH IT WERE A HAIR BIT THICKER, BUT THE PRODUCT IS AWESOME AND DOESNT DESERVE A LOWER RATING BECAUSE OF IT.

I don't use blush and couldn't tell you how it works as a blush brush.  Was a little worried that it would be flimsy or harsh considering the price, but it turned out to be an excellent kabuki brush...  so gentle and soft.

4.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B00X4DKZKU,"I've been using this at night for a little over a week now.  I am mostly happy with it, but I don't think it is going to be a ""must buy"" product for me, because there are other leave-ins that I like just a little more (It's a 10 is my favorite).  But, due to ingredients, this could be an option for you, and it is a good product.  (More on ingredients below.)

I have waist-length, color-treated hair.  I shampoo it every day (I work out and sweat a lot so I pretty much have to).  So it gets a little dry.  I use a bit of hair oil on the roots and then I spray this throughout the length.  I use it on semi-damp, partially towel-dried hair after showering.  I comb it through with a detangling brush and I do have to say, this is an excellent detangler.

The next morning, my hair is soft and shiny.  Maybe the ends are not perfect, but the majority of the length of the hair looks lovely.  I am docking a star, though, because this just does not take care of frizz for me.  We recently had a super rainy weekend and, even though I was using this, I had poofy hair with frizz, so I had to use additional hair oil the next day to take care of that.

This is lightweight.  I was just guessing as to how much to use and sometimes the guessing goes wrong for me with products like this.  However, I never managed to put too much of this in my hair and my hair was never weighed down, never looked greasy or dirty.  I was using somewhere between 5 and 8 sprays on my hair, I think.  I did not get product buildup over time, either, which is great.

I don't notice much of a scent although this does have some fragrance ingredients (no artificial dyes, though).  It seems, based on my experience, safe to use every day.  Here is the ingredients list since I didn't see it on the product page:

Water, Coconut Oil, Argan Kernel Oil, Rosa Canina Fruit Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate, Shea Butter, Hibiscus Flower Extract, C20-22 Alcohols*, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Esters, Orange Peel Oil, Grapefruit Peel Oil, Lemon Peel Oil, Tangerine Peel Oil, Sandalwood Oil, Glycerin, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Isohexadecane, Polysorbate 60, Polysorbate 80, Fragrance, Aminomethyl Propanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid.

This is a vegan product, if that is of concern to you.

Overall, this did have a lot of good properties and I will definitely finish my bottle.  I just need something that deals with frizz a little more for my next purchase.  If frizz is not a problem for you, or if you want a bit of additional volume along the length of your hair, in addition to the detangling and shine/softness benefits, this may work for you.","great detangler, leaves hair soft and shiny, not wonderful at controlling frizz","Briogeo - Rosarco Milk Reparative Leave-In Conditioning Spray, Ultra-Lightweight Leave-In Conditioner for Those with Dry, Damaged, and Brittle Hair, 5 oz"

4.0,AT53ZTTO707MB,B00YB5YZME,"This combo callus remover/epilator/shaver has several things going for it:  I love that it is lighted, and that the light is nice and bright and angled properly so that I can see tiny hairs and see what I'm doing.  It has a great ergonomic grip and it feels good in the hand.  Best of all, it is rechargeable and that means that it is more powerful than similar hand-helds that use AA batteries.  It charges over night and gets one through over 30 minutes of use without starting to squeal in defeat.

That being said:  The three different heads are smaller than other similar hand-helds that I own......The roller head on the callus remover is not wide enough and the roller is also a smaller diameter (means that the roller revolves faster per second; but that does not mean it works better or more efficiently).  There is only one roller head for the callus remover, and it has a fine-grade grit.  Fine-grade is adequate for touch-up work, but if one does not buff their feet often, fine-grade grit is not enough to remove tough calluses.  A half-hour working time for the battery will not remove tough calluses.  You will need to recharge and give it another go the next day, and the next day, and the next.....Of course, one can leave the appliance plugged into the adapter and a wall outlet.  In that case, you can continue on, but it will take you a long time to wear down a tough, thick callus with this fine-grade grit roller.  The kit should really contain a coarse-grade grit roller, in addition.

New roller heads are NOT available for sale at this time, although the seller assures me that they are soon to be added.  Also, the heads on this appliance have a bit of a bough, or curve, on one side, so they are not interchangeable with other makes and models.

The epilator works decently.  Like I already said the head is narrower than most, so it does take at least quadruple the time to remove hair from one leg, as opposed to shaving. It removes most hairs, but misses a lot of fine hairs.

The razor works okay, but it does not cut real close to the skin.  It does leave a slight stubble.

Thinking through all the pros and cons, I would like to say that my four-star rating is a low one--maybe 3.5, if Amazon offered it.

5.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B00YB5YZME,"I really liked the idea of this product - three tools in one.  I wasn't sure it would be good at each of the three functions, but in the end, it was much better than I expected it to be.  And I will definitely be getting a lot of use out of it!

I tried the epilator in my bikini area.  It did hurt, but I would expect that when hairs are getting pulled out by the root.  It did best on hairs that were 1/4 inch or longer.  (I have an Emjoi epilator that works about the same.)  It is not quite as wide as my other epilator, but the narrowness is perhaps quite well suited to use under the arms.  As an epilator, it did an excellent job.

I used the shaver part under my arms.  Although the manual recommends doing this after you shower, I did it before, when there was still deodorant residue under my arms, and I still got a very close shave.  I do not have any other shavers to compare to as I typically use a manual razor for this.  But I was definitely happy with the performance, even on the uneven surface of my underarm.

And I used the callus remover on the sides and bottom of my heels.  I did this when they were dry and you could see as the outer layer of dead skin cells just came off.  My feet were a little softer right as soon as I used this, but it's going to take a few weeks of regular use for best results.  It didn't hurt at all.

This is rechargeable.  I like not being tethered to the wall for certain activities (for example, it would be difficult to use this on the feet while plugged in).  To first charge it, I just left it plugged in overnight.  I am not sure how long it actually took to charge, because the red ""charging"" light never went off.  However, when I unplugged it to use, it stayed on the whole time.  (I would estimate I ran it for about 10 minutes, total, the first time I tried it.)  So it defnitely holds a charge long enough to get the job done.

This does have a little light on it that can help guide you, if you are so inclined to use it.  (It's on whenever the unit is on.)  This only has one button/switch, so it's easy to operate.  It's also quite easy to change out the various heads.  It's a bit difficult to clean, especially the epilator part (it comes with a little brush that may help) but my other epilator has similar problems due to the nature of how all epilators work.

Note: after epilating, it's a good idea to use something like pfb Vanish (a roll-on product designed to prevent ingrown hairs).  You don't have to choose that brand; there are others that do essentially the same thing.

I do wish this came with a storage case or pouch (I guess you can put it back in the box?).  But other than that, this device exceeded my expectations and should be especially handy for travel (i.e., no lugging 2 or 3 separate devices around).

- It's thick/dense - the bristles are tightly packed so it applies contour powder/foundation right where you want it
- Super soft - the synthetic bristles are really soft, making this brush feel wonderful against your skin.
- It works well!!  I had previously been using an eyeshadow brush to apply contour before trying this brush and I am really glad to have this one now because it is so much quicker and a more even distribution of product before buffing out.  It works well because you can use this to apply contour thick to then buff out with a kabuki brush or you can use this same brush and just apply a little contour and there is no need to buff it out after because this provides such a great even soft distribution if you want it to.

Overall I LOVE this brush and definitely recommend it.  It's an awesome price and so worth it.

5.0,AI8DDPX23JCV2,B00YEADF7C,"This kit is AMAZING!!  I couldn't be more happy with this kit.  Okay maybe if the lancet was a little sharper that would be nice, but overall this is an amazing blackhead remover kit.  Before getting this kit I had one little black head remover tool that I rarely used because I rarely felt like it was the right tool for the job.  But now I feel like there is a tool for every and any kind of blackhead, whitehead, blemish I could get.  I love this kit!!

PROS
' Comes with 5 tools, so 10 different heads you could possibly use for any individual thing that needs popping/squeezing.
' Comes with a great set of directions from the seller - so if you purchase this check your email because the seller sent me the instructions and directions after purchasing it.

CONS:
' Lancet part could be sharper, but then again it's probably good that I'm not able to cut deep with it because I don't want to scar my face while using this.

Brief summary of the helpful descriptions that come (via email) about of the different types of extractors that come in the kit.
Spoon shaped extractor (hole in the middle) its over the blackhead. As gentle pressure is applied to the area, the trapped oil/blackhead pushes out and is released from the skin.
The lancet (needle shaped) end can be used to puncture whiteheads (if it's sharp) - which is good to release the oil/bacteria.
Thin angled curette (looped shape) extractor is used to roll out mature white heads and the flat side to press out blackheads.
Curve angled curette (loop shape) extractor has a unique shape for hard to reach places.
Angled curette extractors come in different shapes and sizes for those delicate areas of the face or body.

Overall I LOVE this kit and am very pleased with the quality of the extractor and how easily they have made it to extract blemishes/blackheads from my skin.

I put a couple drops on a cotton ball and ran it over the artificial flowers and surprisingly it worked!

5.0,A27TB72QV6SBID,B012KPK5PW,"This Victoria Featherlight Body Wrap Kit is pretty much a spa in your own home. I'm much bigger than the average woman so doing anything like this in an actual spa is out of the question. While this does say it's good for losing inches I mainly got this to try because it also said it helps reduce stretch marks; yes I would love to lose inches since I do have some clothes that are a little too tight I also would love to be able to see my stretch marks be gone.

I have only used this kit once so far as you only need to use it once a week for 6 weeks and then once a month but I can already tell you that I love it. This kit is super easy to use as it's got clear step by step instructions. The kit comes with 2 ace bandages and 8 packets of clay powder so you do get enough to be able to see if it'll even work. I love how relaxing this body wrap is and for a complete hour I get to relax while the clay sits and does it's magic.

I have sensitive skin and didn't have any problems at all using this kit; in fact the clay actually made my skin feel really soft and smooth after using it. I did notice that after just one use that my skin did feel like it was a little tighter than it normally is. I'm absolutely looking forward to the next 7 times I get to use this kit! I would definitely recommend this Victoria Featherlight Body Wrap Kit!

4.0,A16AXQ11SZA8SQ,B012KPK5PW,"I've been losing weight (so far, 30 pounds, and 60 more to go).  Needless to say, this has left my flabby body even flabbier, with looser skin.  I was excited with offered this Detox Body Wrap at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.  It's fairly easy (though messy) to use.

* Boil some water, remove from heat, add the wraps (basically extra wide ace bandages) and allow to set for 10-15 minutes;
* After the water/wraps have cooled for 10-15 minutes, mix the clay powder with warm water and apply to the desired area;
* Remove wraps from water, wring until no longer dripping;
* When you burn yourself from wring the wraps, place them in a spagetti strainer to cool further, then wring the rest of the water out;
* Wrap the bandages around the desired area (I did my tummy), and secure with the included clips;
* When the clips break, go get some safety pins (which I should have got before I started all this), and use them to secure the wraps.
* Put a warm damp towel over the wraps (or do as I did and use neoprene wraps, which are better at holding in heat);
* Wait at least an hour before removing everything;
* Then clean up the mess you made, and measure yourself.

As you can see, there were a few kinks.  I needed to let the wraps cool longer before trying to use them, and the clips ALL bent to the point I was unable to use them.  That said, I noticed a definite improvement in my skin tone.  I've attached Before/After pictures (using a ""cutout"" artistic effect -- lets face it, nobody wants to see a fat, old tummy in Amazon's pictures).  You can see that I still have a lot of work to do, but the after picture showed definite improvement.  While I received this at a deep discount for review purposes, I plan on buying more of this product at full price to keep toning and tightening my skin as I lose more weight.  If I meet my goal weight, I will post picture of the final result.

4.0,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B01310WRTC,"This is a medium-sized mitt with a layer of very rough, but strong fabric on both sides and an elastic band at the wrist to help it stay on. The fabric is held together by solid stitching which was flawless on my mitt. It is super strong despite being thin. The fabric is rather surprisingly rough when you rub it against your skin. It's like sandpaper that does not do any damage. It leaves your skin feeling smoother and cleaner after use because it so vigorously rubs off outer dead skin cells. If you have thin or super sensitive skin, I'm not sure how this would feel. I'm the sort of person who scratches hard, so I loved this. It felt effective and it felt invigorating. The type of rough stimulation likely stimulates blood vessels close to the surface of the skin. I wouldn't be surprised if it had positive effects in terms of cleaning through increased blood flow.

The only point about this which I was not happy about was the inner seem around the elastic band at the bottom (see photo). The interior is stitched well, but it is also sealed at the edges with what seems to be melted plastic. Mine had sharp edges that I had to trim off with scissors in order to stop it from digging into my wrists uncomfortably. This ragged edge should be more refined. Though cutting it off isn't difficult, I'm concerned that cutting off too much will result in fraying the elastic resulting it in eventually unraveling so one must trim lightly and carefully.

I've been trying to make healthy choices such as drinking lots of water, exercising frequently and eating nutritiously. I easily lost 20 pounds, struggled during the last 5 pounds. I have some loose skin that occasionaly needs to be tightened with wraps. These wraps do a great job of making my skin feel more firm. Although I don't get much shrinkage (about an inch and a half each use), these wraps are great for short term results when I need to show my stomach in public like at a pool. The results from the wrap lasts for about 24-48 hours for me before I go back to my normal inches. These wraps are large and can be cut up to use other areas other than the stomach. I don't like to wear these wraps overnight although many people do , because I like to drink tons of water to flush the toxins. I'm talking about drinking 120 ounces at least!!! The wraps stick on and don't leave any residue upon removal. Recommended product! I do wish that I lost more inches from it, though.

5.0,A2XZM64TLWL34O,B013RJY9A2,"Searching for a safe and effective skin brightener is always my top priority because I have a never ending battle with skin discoloration and dark sunspots. I love the fact that this serum is gentle and does not contain the harsh chemicals that most skin lighteners do because I prefer using products that have natural and botanical ingredients as much as possible. This product comes in a dark amber dropper bottle which protects the product from sunlight exposure. It also contains Glycolic and Kojic Acids as the key ingredients which I believe will lead to clear and brighter looking skin. This serum keeps my skin smooth, shining and flake-free. It is not greasy and does not form a film. I have somewhat sensitive skin which is pone to irritation and redness, but this serum is very gentle without causing any breakouts or negative side effects. I believe it has been gradually improving my dull looking appearance by making the spots a bit lighter.

I use the product as directed after cleansing, toning my face and allowing some time to dry before topping with my regular moisturizer. This light weight clear serum not only applies smoothly and evenly, but it also has a fresh light scent that will dissipate after it dries. It has a liquid gel like texture which leaves my skin soft and smooth, not to mention it is also fast absorbing without any uncomfortable feeling and leaves my face quite moisturized. I have even started using it to lighten the sun spots on my hands and the results are impressive. Although I have not been using it for long, my skin tone has started to look more even and I have also noticed that some of my blemishes have cleared up along the way. My darker spots still exist, but they look much better and I can see some significant improvements of my lighter ones.

I am sure everyone's skin is different, but I have experienced zero sensitivity or dryness. I love how much clearer my skin looks throughout the day and my skin feels more balanced. My overall appearance is much brighter and smoother. The brown spots on my hands are slowly fading in under two weeks and I can say that I am really happy about it. In fact, everybody's skin type is different and the effects may not be the same or visible for everyone. I have used it twice a day for quite some time now and the brightening effect seems to be progressing. There is no miraculous or overnight whitening as such, but with gradual fading of sun spots, my face does appear clearer and even toned. This product does what it promises and lightens my dark spots. This is a great and reasonably priced dark spot corrector serum that I will definitely buy again and I feel quite confident to explore other products from the same line to further improve my skin conditions.

4.0,AJ9ZYMEUY14AX,B013TXDDJY,"Overview: I had a baby a year and a half ago, and gained forty pounds that wouldn't budge. I lost 20 lbs on my own, but the last 25 have been stubborn. After losing 4 more pounds, I still haven't seen the shrinkage in my waistline. Yes, my arms, face, thighs shrink, but the c-section pooch is still there. I got these wraps hoping that I will be able to see some of my loose skin firms up to get rid of the pooch I have. I wear a size large in shirts and size 10 in pants. Before the wrap, my waist measured 36 inches, and after 4 hours using the wrap drinking TONS of water, my waist measured 34.5. 1.5 inches down!

The wraps are not a cream color as shown in the image. They are clear with gel on the inside.

Pros:
-Inches shrunk. My waistline didn't visibly shrink, but it did physically shrink as I lost 1.5 inches. I would have loved to have lost more from the wraps like other ladies.
-Skin felt taut. The skin felt firm upon removal of the wrap. It says to rub the rest of the gel in, but I just wanted to shower the gel off :/
-LARGE. These wraps covered down my pooch under my hip bones, across and around to my back(hips) and even up to my ribcage. I could totally see cutting one in many parts to use it in different areas of the body. You would need some shaaaaarp scissors.
-Easy application. Once you unfold the wrap, it is easy to slap it on and wrap in some plastic wrap. It stays in place.

Cons:
-Plastic wrap. The plastic wrap squinches as you move. It says overnight, but I want to drink water while wearing it! I'd leave it for an at-home spa day.
-Smell. The gel smells like the numbing agent they use at the dentist's office. It made me gag a bit. As soon as the plastic wrap is applied, the smell is no longer apparent.

Grade: This product receives 4 stars because it made me lose inches, but it stinkies!

4.0,A1JDBXPK20HBUW,B013XKHA4M,"After so much hype, I felt compelled to try it myself, especially since I now live in the desert and in the last couple of weeks, there were a couple of d days where it was 107+ at 4% humidity. (Did you even know that was possible?)

- Moisturizing: off the bat, I'll say that if you put this on after your shower on still-wet/moist skin, it absorbs beautifully and really hydrates your skin. It's not just about looking moisturized, but you FEEL moisturized. For a good 1-2 hours post-shower, I am consistently amazed by that feeling of moisture just creeping into my skin, even though it doesn't look like I have any cream left on my body.

- Scent: Unlike others who rave about the scent, I am not a huge fan of the scent. I tend to love my cocoa-butter scented items or things reminiscent of suntan lotion which conjures up images of Hawaiian beaches or sipping a cocktail in Fiji when you're in mid-city traffic. I like how this is heavily scented -- but the scent is more ""warm"" than ""beautiful,"" if that makes any sense. I actually prefer the scent half a day later when you can still whiff some remnants on your skin. That said, it's amazing that when you sweat, the scent comes back to life so I suppose for some who get stinky when they sweat, this is a good thing. Note: I also use this with the body perfume from the same brand...my motto in life is ""Go big or go home,"" what can I say?

- Price: I don't care about the price of the jar itself, but given the amount I use after every shower, which I take every single day, I think one jar will last me about 30-40 days. THEN, this jar is expensive, especially compared to other body lotions and creams. One of my long-time favorites --&nbsp;Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula With Vitamin E Lotion Fragrance Free , 13.5-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)&nbsp;-- is less than $30 for FOUR bottles that are 13.5 ounce each -- and every single bit as moisturizing. Your skin feels like a baby's bottom for the entire day with this stuff. While this is not a scientific claim, I daresay the Palmer's will penetrate more and leave your skin softer overall -- but the BBC instantly absorbs more. Can I justify buying Brazilian Bum Bum Cream when these bottles I have everywhere in my house moisturize just as well, if not more? The four bottles I buy at a time lasts me over a year -- and I have one by the kitchen for my hands, one in my office for random ""OMG I WANT TO MOISTURIZE"" moments, one in the car, and one in my master bath, where the BBC now resides as well. Buying four jars of BBC -- almost $200. No thanks.

Finally -- the sparkles. I am not big on having sparkles on my skin. It's not an excessive amount, but it's definitely there. I like a glow as much as anyone--but I like it oil and moisture-based. Sparkles -- not too crazy about. Then again, maybe it looks fabulous under a disco ball, which I haven't been under in eons. But for daily usage, I'm not big on the sparkles.

For these reasons, I don't think I'll be repurchasing, but it is a very nice body cream. I'll save the rest of the jar for occasions when I am going out and want to smell like an island, but for daily usage, this is not really a worthwhile purchase. But it is a really good body cream.","Beautifully Absorbent, But Worth the Price?","Sol De Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream, 8.1 Fl oz"

4.0,A1VUXNNB1NJ2PT,B0140TEQDI,"-Edited to add a star, because I've now used the white on an actual nail and it did better than anticipated.-
This is OK nail polish, but I bought it because the description said it was good for stamping, so I thought it would give me really better results than the regular (mostly Wet and Wild) polishes I have been using so far. The black does seem more opaque and with it I got swatches I am quite happy with. The gold is brighter yellow, and perhaps a little more opaque than my current polish. The silver also seemed to work well. But after swatching on paper, I'm pretty sure the red and blue would only show up on a really light base color. The white showed up somewhat on top of darker colors, but didn't particularly stand out. I was able to get nice crisp images with all of the colors, so points for that. For what it's worth, the polish isn't particularly thick.and dries fairly quickly.  All in all, I'm fairly happy with the black, gold and silver, less so with the white, and least of all with the red and blue. I expect I will come up with uses for them, they just aren't quite what I was hoping for.

It does a great job with moisture retention, unlike some moisturizers that just doesn't quite do a great job as far as keeping my face from getting plagued with dry patches. I love the fact that this particular formula is organic, fragrance free and all natural. My skin soaks it beautifully and it works wonderfully with other organic face products that I use. After using it religiously for quite some time, I must say that my skin looks healthier and my complexion looks more clear. Two thumbs up for this product!

I love how my skin feels after the mask. Both products are orangy in color and the mask has a pleasant smell. Even though it is orange it quickly absorbs and dry with no tight feeling, or, at least, I didn't experience. The instructions state to leave on for 15-30 minutes of which I did the full 30 minutes. I have used some masks that dry and crack and scare small children and pets, but with this hydration mask, you don't have that. You can go about your business, well at home anyway, then rinse off after the allotted time. The skin on my face felt nice and smooth and soft.

The True Glow Eye Cream I applied every night after cleansing, it absorbs quickly. I am 62 so the use of products that aid in the aging process is important to me.

5.0,AEC90GPFKLAAW,B014TOT602,"I've used many different tweezers over the years and really hadn't found a pair I totally loved.  This set has turned out to be perfect - I've been using two of them for several months now, and highly recommend them.

The regular slant tweezers do such a great job with plucking.  They have such a precision tip that they don't break off the hairs.  They grip securely every time and avoid the breakage that causes ingrown hairs.  I've also used the needle tip ones to remove ingrown hairs left by other tweezers and I love that they are super sharp and pointed - quickly grasping the hair under the skin and removing it without tearing up my skin.  They would also work very well to remove splinters without having to dig.  The curved tweezers are also very nice but I haven't needed to use them yet.  I imagine they would be good for placing small items for gluing, or for reaching into very small openings to retrieve something.

The whole set is made of high quality stainless steel, which makes them easy to disinfect with alcohol or soap and water.  The handles are brushed to give a more secure grip and the size of them (about 4 inches) is perfect for the average hand. Being stainless steel, they won't ever rust and the edges will stay sharp and aligned for many years.  I received the silver colored set, although the product page says they come in 4 colors.

I actually threw away my Tweezerman tweezers after I started using the Beneleaf tweezers. I didn't realize how much extra work the Tweezerman ones cost me in repeatedly plucking the same hair, broken hairs and later ingrown hairs. Plus my Tweezerman tweezers were $20, and this set of 3 Beneleaf precision tweezers is $23!  If you are also fighting a cheap or worn out set of tweezers, I highly recommend this Beneleaf set.

I received a complimentary set of Beneleaf professional tweezers for testing and review purposes. I wasn't asked to leave a positive review, nor was I paid or otherwise compensated for reviewing this product. Look at the hundreds of reviews I've written over thirteen years and you'll see that I work hard to give an honest opinion of the products I review.","Precision Stainless, My favorite tweezers ever!","Tweezers for Eyelash Extensions - Set of 3 - Strong Grip, Stainless Steel, Tube Case.

I like the packaging of this product. It is clean, simple, and to the point. I love that it comes in a bottle with a pump; very hygienic and easy to use! A pump was enough serum to cover my whole face and some of my neck, which means that this bottle will last me a long time. The serum itself has a light and pleasant scent. The scent wasn't noticeable once I applied the product to my face. The serum went smoothly onto my face. As it was absorbing into my skin, my face felt sticky. That went away completely in a couple of minutes and I was left with very soft skin. I use this product in the morning under my makeup, and it does help to make my face brighter and look more awake in the morning! I have noticed that with regular use of this serum, my skin is brighter and my fine lines are diminishing, which is amazing!

Vitamin C serums can be used for more than just the face. Vitamin C is great for helping with stretch marks and aging hands. My mother has always used vitamin C on her hands, and as a result her hands look very young for her age! I am excited to try this serum for this purpose as well!

Vitamin C is known to help with fading scars, firming skin, and reducing inflammation. This serum also has other ingredients that are beneficial for the skin in terms of anti-aging, acne, and redness.

Manuka Oil is a lot like Tea Tree Oil in that it's anti-inflammatory and antibacterial which makes it perfect to use on blemishes to speed up healing and recovery.
This Manuka Oil by Natural Beauty Limited is a 100% pure and natural essential oil and I have to say that it worked wonders on my spots.  Normally, when I have a bad reaction like the one that I had it takes weeks to heal but I started seeing results in a matter of days.  I was very consistent and used the Manuka Oil twice a day directly on the spots.  Manuka Oil is also Cicatrisant and Cytophylactic which helps promote new cell growth and healing and It think is a big reason why I saw such immediate results.
Manuka Oil and Tea Tree Oil have a lot of similarities, smell being one of them, but I feel like I had better results with the Manuka Oil than I've ever had with Tea Tree Oil.  Not sure why and it could even be because I was so consistent with the application of the Manuka Oil but whatever the reason I will be keeping the Manuka Oil on hand at all times!

5.0,A2JCJJNY43QQIV,B0166R22CO,"Legend has it that after Essie discontinued Starry Starry Night (introduced in 1985) that women worldwide kept searching high and low for the amazing nail polish. So much so that rare bottles popped up on ebay, bringing hundreds of dollars.

No need to run up your credit card anymore! Essie reintroduced SSN (that's for 'Starry Starry Night,' not your social security number) in its Retro Revival Collection, and the polish sold out online in a nanosecond. The good news is that it's just now coming into your local Essie retailer, so pick up a bottle or two as a backup.

This polish is worth the hype. It's amazing, kind of like a navy jelly base with the subtle silver glimmer of a million stars in a sky unmarred by light pollution. I absolutely adore it (and yes, I picked up a spare, since this polish is that wonderful.)

Unlike some reviewers' experiences, I found the formula to be fine, not thick, not goopy. I used a base coat, as you should with anything this dark to prevent staining, and I got full opacity in two coats. The polish last almost a week before signs of chipping, and even then, it was minimal. (Your mileage may vary.)

Old timers say that this isn't quite the same as the original SSN; that may be true, but ignorance is bliss in my case. I love this polish! (And I'm not bidding $$$ for the original, either.)

5.0,A2XZM64TLWL34O,B0167XBHO6,"I am not a stranger to Vitamin C skincare products, but this power serum by Skederm is very different from all the Vitamin C serums that I have tried before. I always have ongoing problems of uneven skin tone and under eye dark circles. This special blend of serum is formulated to target signs of aging including dark spots, skin dehydration and dull skin tones. Unfortunately, it is exactly what I need at this point of my life. It may not be fast and effective against deep wrinkles though, but nothing really is other than cosmetic surgeries. The serum is quickly absorbed into the skin and does not feel greasy or gel-like silicone texture that a lot of serums have. It does have a pleasant light scent which quickly dissipates after applied and the consistency of the serum is somewhat creamy. It spreads very easily and one pump is enough to cover my face so the bottle should last quite awhile. When I apply this serum after cleansing and toning, I immediately feel as if my skin has been infused with moisture. It soaks right in and makes my skin feel more hydrated. It feels smooth and luxurious when I spread it over my face and neck. I have not experienced any irritation or negative reaction to this serum. Nevertheless, it is gentle enough to apply even under my eyes without any burning or itching sensation which has happened with a lot of beauty products I tried over the years.

I really adore the elegant packaging, it comes in a beautiful airtight pump style bottle which protects the ingredients and keeps them fresh. It's sanitary and dispenses just the right amount for each application. I instantly love the way it makes my face feel soft and supple on first use and the results over the past week alone have continued to smooth my skin significantly. My face looks and feels more smooth, firm, and has this radiant glow that makes me look so much energetic. It has also helped balance my overall complexion. Even though I have exclusively been using this serum for about a week. I do not expect it to work miracles, but if it can hold moisture to the surface of my skin to give it the appearance of being smoother, then it is doing exactly what I need it to do. I do notice after using it that my skin feels tighter. I have not noticed any change in my fine lines yet, but the texture of my skin is starting to look better already. I am pleased with what I have seen so far and I am fully aware that I should give it at least a month to see results just like with any skincare product on the market. I will continue using this serum to document what my results are over time.

It has a thin texture and absorbs quickly without any sticky residue.  But it's not primarily water.  Nothing against water, but I prefer my serums to have some thickness to them to allow the ingredients time to penetrate my skin.  This one has the feel of a light cream and a soft citrus scent.  Also the ingredients are superior.  It has the sodium hyaluronate version of HA, biotin, squalane and most importantly 3-O Ethyl Abscorbic acid.  Also the unique pump top bottle gives me full control and delays oxidation.  Highly recommended

4.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B016QSRYR6,"This is the latest product I tried in my seemingly never-ending search for the perfect makeup remover.  I'm partial to wipes and towelettes because of the convenience -- both remover product and applicator in one (no running out of cotton balls or cotton pads at a different time than the remover product).

I'd previously tried some eye makeup remover pads (circular, in a screw-top canister) from Yes to Cucumbers and I hadn't been thrilled with those because they made my eyes water a bit.  However, these towelettes have been fine to use around my eyes -- usually quite gentle, in fact.  I've been using them to remove mascara and they've been doing an exceptional job; they're also pretty good at removing lip stains.

I like the packaging on the larger package sizes (i.e., 30 count).  The plastic cover snaps shut and keeps the towelettes from drying out, which is great since I only use maybe five of these a week so the whole package lasts for a month and a half.  It's a lot better than the wipe/towelette packages that only have a sticky flap to press over the opening (these have the sticky flap, too, but also the plastic door).

I have somewhat sensitive skin but this has not bothered me very much in that respect.  I don't notice much of a smell when I use these, either.

The other thing I really like is the size -- if you need to rub a little bit to get all your eye makeup off, you can constantly move to a fresh area of the towelette, or switch to the other side (the sides are equivalent in terms of texture), so you can actually get the makeup off instead of moving it around.",like these more than the Yes To Cucumbers circular eye makeup remover pads,"Yes To Cucumber Hypoallergenic Facial Towelettes, 30 Count (Pack of 6)"

5.0,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B016V8YWBC,"Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar in Deep clean has a very neutral odor best described as simply soapy with no noticeable perfume except for maybe the slightest hint of sandalwood so it is not so much masculine as definitely not feminine. It cleans quite well but has moisturizers so it doesn't leave the face feeling dry but rather soft and smooth. There are some visible small black ""purifying grains"" in the ivory-colored bar but perhaps also something else that provides a very gentle exfoliation.

5.0,AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B016V8YWBC,"Well, knock me over.  Here's a men's bar that I really like for myself.  First the scent is wonderful.  Fresh without being overly perfumey.

To give you an idea of how scented it is, we received some of the Dove&nbsp;Dove Men Care Body and Face Wash--Clean Defense&nbsp;and while I liked it on my man, there's no way I would personally use it.  The scent was just over-powering in the shower.

This bar though is mild in comparison and very pleasant.  About on par with the normal pink or green Dove bar soap that we sometimes purchase.  (I think the white has the least smell.  White Dove is our household standard.)

Second, I like how it didn't dry out my skin.  It's Winter and my skins a dry mess right now, but this bar doesn't appear to be making the situation worse.

So definitely would recommend.",Wonderful Smell,"Dove Men+Care, Deep Clean Body + Face Bar, 4 Ounce, 6 Count, (Pack of 2)&hellip;"
4.0,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B016V8YWBC,"I tend to be the sort of person who just buys the cheapest soap with the lightest scent available rather than try to find something with particular qualities. However, after using this soap, I may have to rethink that habit. This soap really does seem to leave skin feeling both clean (with no film left after rinsing) and quite soft. The claims on the back about containing 1/4 moisturizing cream appear to be quite true. Compared to the sometimes tight, post shower feel that I get with my usual choice of soap (generally the plain Kirkland brand at Costco), this is clearly a superior bar of soap.

The only drawback to this soap is the scent, which is the usual strong smell for men's hair and body products. If it were a little less intense, it'd be okay, but it is so strong that the paper box the soap comes in reeks of it. If you're okay with the strong smell and you want something which leaves you very clean but still with soft skin, this is a pretty good choice which is several cuts above the cheap stuff.","Perfect, except for the strong scent","Dove Men+Care, Deep Clean Body + Face Bar, 4 Ounce, 6 Count, (Pack of 2)&hellip;"
5.0,A35W3JQYP0M655,B016V8YWBC,"I was surprised when I recently saw this product in the store.  Seems it has been around for a while and I had missed it somehow.  I confess that in the past I have washed with my wifes Dove bar.  I loved the scent and the luxury of it.  But it was a little too strong and slippery for me, and it didn't do too well when I was really dirty.  This mens Dove has a great spicy masculine scent and really does a great job of deep cleaning.  I have used both the fresh and the deep cleaning and prefer the deep cleaning.  The extra fresh I would recommend for those that really need a deodorant soap.  In either case however, one thing I really love about this soap is its ability really get you clean, and at the same time moisturize your skin.  Dry skin is a real problem for many here in New England in winter when the air is so bone dry.  Washing down with this really has helped, and, unlike the ladies Dove, you really feel clean in spite of the moisturizing ability.  Trust me guys, a cake of this stuff will spoil you.  It's great.

The only thing I can say that I don't like about this soap is that it gets used up very quickly.  In no time it seems the bar is down and its time to crack open another one.  Gets a little expensive in an area that most of us don't consider a budget to be much of a factor.  But for what it is and does, this Mens Dove is well worth the expense, and is an excellent soap that I highly recommend... : )",Really Good For Dry Skin...Great Scent,"Dove Men+Care, Deep Clean Body + Face Bar, 4 Ounce, 6 Count, (Pack of 2)&hellip;"

It's easy to feel the quality of this nozzle right out of the box.  It's sturdy and made mostly of metal, with a nice grip.  It's comfortable to hold, and easy to squeeze.  When it came in, my husband was doubting it would be as good as the one we have- we have a good one with brass fittings that we've thought was great - but he took it outside and this one is every bit as good - it is easy to turn, click-locks into place for the different settings, sprays exactly the way it should, and does NOT leak.  This one has a more comfortable handle though, and an overall sturdier construction.

The main thing I have to have a nozzle like this for is the fine mist for misting seeds.  This one has one, and it works great, delivering a very fine mist of water that's easy to control the strength of.  The 'jet' setting throws water the most distant and with the most force, and is a good setting for cleaning off a patio or concrete.","Works as well as any I've used, with no leaks, and a very comfortable hand grip","Piero Lorenzo NT-01 Heavy Duty Metal Garden Hose Nozzle Sprayer / Car Wash Gun- 7 Spraying Patterns - High Pressure - For Car / Pet Washing, Garden/Lawn Watering,Deck/Floor Cleaning7 Spraying Patterns"

5.0,A1F7YU6O5RU432,B0172DMOL0,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this face brush, as I've tried a few of these Clarisonic-like devices before and some have been better than others. This one surprised me. It worked really well. First off, I expected it to be smaller than it is. The last one of the face cleaners I received from another company was half this size, and the advertised price was even more. So just opening the box I was thrilled to find it wasn't another mini version.

Packaged with this Fyola cleaner comes one brush already attached, with a cover on the brush to protect the bristles. Also included is a second brush head, with slightly firmer bristles, and also has a cover on it. There's also a charging cable and a charging stand.

I was pleasantly surprised to find it was a wireless charging device. You just set the Fyola in the stand and it starts charging. Note that it needs to be in the charging stand facing away from you, not towards you like you might expect. You'll know you have it in the right way because the face cleaner will beep at you and the lights for each of the various setting will light up showing it's charging.

When the battery runs low, the Fyola beeps at you to let you know it's needing recharged. There are 4 different cleaning settings, sensitive, pulse life massage, exfoliate and deep clean. And they aren't kidding when they call the 4th setting deep clean. It's a strong setting that works great for getting color-stay foundation makeup out of pours.

There is an included instruction manual but it's so easy to use you really don't need to reference it for much, other than maybe familiarizing yourself with which setting is which.  The Fyola works surprisingly well and is a great full sized face cleaner.

5.0,A3QKWFC92S03MP,B0176E2C62,"The Hairika Hair Straightener paddle brush definitely works at making my wavy or curly hair straight.
The packaging is really nice. It comes in a magnetic closure box with 2 hair clips and a cute light weight black zippered pouch.
My experience with this cool innovative hair straightener was very surprising and pleasant except when I kept holding the paddle a bit higher, then I would burn my hands.
But I learned the hard way to hold it correctly. LOL
My hair sheds a lot too so a lot of hair got in the brush but while it was hot, I was able to lift the hair from the device.
I have wavy hair but I used the Hairika paddle brush on a curly hairstyle I previously had done the day before and as soon as I ran the brush through my hair, I immediately saw my hair getting straightened.
I also realized not just too brush the hair normally but to hold and lift out the hair that needs to be straightened then place the paddle brush straightener on to it.
When I tried the lower various temperatures, it was not getting out the curls but when I switched it to the higher temp of 210 C it flattened my hair and no burn or damage was present.
It gave me a nice smooth and silky finish except not pin straight hair which is ok because I like a little wave on the tips but it did take out the curls as you can see in the pictures below.

Some nights i donrlt have to apply it at all!

If they don't have any signs, I don't and check again in the morning. Within the week that we have been using this soap, I would say that our cream usage has been cut in half!

Pros:
+ Low price
+ Mild abrasion
+ Runs on cheap AA batteries
Cons:
 - No storage case to keep everything together
 - Much slower than manual filing
 - Cheap construction
 - Feels like it could break at any time
 - No replacement files
My wife and I had such high hopes for this electric file.  We cut one of our 13 month old son's nails a little too close a few months ago and ever since that happened, he's terrified when we clip his nails.. Kicking, screaming, crying, and the problem is his nails grow at warp speed so once a week clipping is a must.  The good thing about this product is that he's not afraid of the gentle filing action.  But it feels like it could break any second.  The plastic doesn't feel solid.  The file head wobbles around like it might fly off with a gust of wind, and the on/ off bottom is junky.  Plus it comes with one set of files and then it's apparantly disposable so even at this great price, you're better off buying anything else

I decided to do one side of my hair to show the difference in the attached photo.  I do have thick hair so I have to divide my hair in order to get to the hair underneath.  I was impressed how the brush glided through my hair smoothly without tangling or hesitation.  It left my hair silky and shiny - that is the ceramic icons at work!

The only features I did not care for is being unable to change the temperature readout from Celsius to Fahrenheit and not being able to lock the temperature setting.  My fingers repeatedly touched the buttons and would lower and sometimes turn off the brush.

The brush does get extremely hot so I strongly recommend using a heat styling glove.  I would probably use the brush for touch-ups, but will continue to use my flat iron to completely straighten my hair since it is just a time consuming if not, maybe even takes up more time since you have to go over your hair repetitively to achieve a pin straight result.

It can be used for either oily or dry skin plus can be used not just on the face but all over where you have dry skin. The only thing I did not like about it was the smell.

5.0,A2XZM64TLWL34O,B018TZTS96,"It is hard to find a moisturizer with skin healthy ingredients and suitable for my skin type. I enjoy this product immensely because it leaves me skin moisturized without the heavy residue most intense moisturizers do. After two straight weeks of using this moisturizer, I have concluded that it works every bit as well, or better than the name brands I have been paying more money for at the department store. This moisturizer leaves my skin comfortable, soft, and matte all day long. The scent is delightful in my opinion and I find myself terribly addicted to the wonderful aroma. Even though it feels light on the skin, it helps my makeup glide on smoothly with absolute moisture. It feels like it disappears as soon as it is rubbed in, and yet it keeps my skin perfectly balanced and moisturized all day without the shiny greasy looking. I especially need something to help my sensitive skin stay hydrated and soft. This moisturizer seems to have just the right formula for that purpose without causing any breakouts.

This facial moisturizer is rich and creamy. I really appreciate that this product is not greasy or sticky. When using this moisturizer, I can actually feel it sink into my skin pretty fast. It instantly makes my face feel very smooth and it soaks in rather quickly without leaving any uncomfortable residues. I have been using this cream twice a day and always making sure to cover my eyelids as well. It is so gentle for my sensitive skin that my skin does not itch or turn red. It is not greasy, but the coverage is thick enough to sufficiently provide moisture for night time. I do not like oily or sticky moisturizers, but I do prefer certain degree of a good moisturizing coverage. This is a very good face cream compared to many other brands of moisturizers that I have used not to mention the fact that it is made by skin healthy ingredients and botanical extracts.

I have only been using it for two weeks and I have noticed that my skin is starting to feel smoother and firmer. However, there has not been much difference in my fine lines yet, but I strongly believe it will further benefit my skin with consistent use. The tone of my skin also seems to be improving and I could not be more happier. This is a good facial moisturizer that I find perfect for my skin type during the day since it has helped my makeup look natural and smoother. I will definitely recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin looking for a good face cream to provide adequate moisture and combat signs of aging.

3.0,A35W3JQYP0M655,B019809F9Y,"I recently started using an electric razor after years of being a supporter of the wet shave market.  Mostly for times when it's convenient and I am in a hurry.  I remember years ago when I used an electric shaver that this Williams lectric shave worked well in making a difference in a close shave.  Picking up a bottle after all these years proves that it still does, and in my opinion a pre shave lotion is a good investment for electric razor users.  That being said, I have to say that somewhere along the line Williams changed their formula somewhat, at least in the scent, for its not the same as I remember to be sure.  Years ago this pre shave smelled as nice as any after shave did.  It was a pleasant but not too strong barber shop sort of spice scent. Now it seems to have a very weak but not at all likable scent that despite its lack of strength still seems to linger on after you shave, even with a rinse.  It reminds me very much of those cheap after shave rip offs you can find in some dollar stores that go on smelling nice for a few minutes, but then quickly turn sour and cheap...  As good as this works at stimulating your beard with a splash of alcohol and other ingredients, my recommendation is to use Afta brand pre shave which I picked up at a local pharmacy, but is also readily available here on Amazon in a two pack at the time of this writing.  In fact I have ordered some here simply because Afta's availability locally is spotty at best.  Williams seems to have a marketing hold in my neck of the woods because its also easy to find.  But I still recommend this only if you don't have any Afta available.  Afta smells much better, works as well if not better than the Willians, and unlike the Williams, to my knowledge has always been the same formula....&nbsp;Mennen Afta Pre-Electric original 3 FL OZ (PACK OF 2)",Works Well......Sour Scent....Afta Is Better,Lectric Shave Pre-Shave Original 3 oz

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor.

However, I am giving this product 4 stars because it doesn't help me get a closer shave as it claims. When you use an electric razor you are supposed to stretch your skin a little bit to stand up the hairs so you can get close and I can do that much better and get closer when shaving dry.

5.0,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B019FWRG3C,"Note: At the time of this review, seven different products are being sold on the same page. I am reviewing the lavendar lavender blossoms.

This is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

When you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

If there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it.",good natural scent,Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Bath &amp; Shower Gel

The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water.

I had high hopes for this bag of lavender from Pre de Provence, but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Lavender should have a fresh scent and a nice purple color. The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much.

The clothes also usually smelled of the fresh outside as we hung our clothes on a line. She would let me spray and iron the hankies and pillow cases. To this day the scent of lavender brings back such happy memories.

The Pre De Provence lavender spray smells fabulous. Not the least bit musty, which some lavender sprays can get a bit of a musty undertone, not this one. It's fresh and clean and brightens the entire room. I iron clothes inside out if I'm going to use any spray, and a light spritz left a wonderful fragrance, not overwhelming, and didn't stain my clothes. I would suggest trying a small out of the way place first.

The spray is also good for just refreshing laundry. Getting out winter clothes from storage that are perfectly clean but could just a use a little pick me up after storage.

also very nice spritzed lightly on the bed a half hour or so before going to bed leaves a clean, lavender sleep experience.

Lavender salts are fragrant salts that you pour into your bathwater when the bathtub is filling with water.  They relax you, and help to ease tensions with their floral fragrances.

These bath salts are quite potent.  A little bit goes a long way, as the scent is pungent.

Pamper yourself after a long day by adding these to your bath.  Relax and inhale the beautiful fragrance of lavender.

5.0,A3TWPW6C78JPGV,B019IMB8TM,"I'd actually prefer to give this 4.5 stars instead of 5, if I could, but since we don't have that option, I'm rounding up.  I bought this brush set with my own money, at a discount, in exchange for a candid review, and given the amount of makeup and makeup brushes I own, I think I'm a pretty good candidate to review this item!

What I Liked:
---It's every bit as pretty as the product image.  The brushes are an aqua-greenish-blue tone with matte black branded handles.
---The brushes are cut fairly well.  So where there are supposed to be rounded angles, the curves are fairly smooth (except for several of the skinny brushes.)
---On the wider brushes, the density is quite good.  If the brush is too sparse, it takes too long to cover your face with foundation.
---The brush hairs are pretty soft.  Not quite as soft as the Urban Decay Good Karma brush, but certainly softer than Bare Minerals brushes, if that helps.

What Could Be Better:
---The handles are longer than they need to be, especially on the skinny brushes.  I don't know why they had to make those so long.
---The handles are branded, but not imprinted with the brush function.  So you just have to figure out what each brush is for.  I've been wearing makeup for 2 decades, and I'd be lying if I said I automatically knew what each brush was for.  I particularly had trouble figuring out what the skinny angled brush and skinny flat top brush are for.  The flat top is a complete mystery to me.
---Given the size of that brush roll, they might as well have included a simple zip pocket.  There's plenty of space for it.

What Doesn't Bother Me At All:
---There's already been some shedding, although that's to be expected.
---The brush roll *is* synthetic, and when you first open it up, it smells like vinyl/pleather/polyurethane, etc.  But it *does* dissipate.  It doesn't stay like that forever.  Maybe some people are just more sensitive, I guess?

I think this is a great set for the price, and part of the charm is the color.  Yes, that may be a stupid reason, but I think there are plenty of people who'll agree anyway.  Will this brush set replace my ridiculously expensive Marc Jacobs foundation brushes?  No.  But that's why you splurge on one top quality foundation brush that lasts forever, and then save some cash when it comes to your blush and highlighter brushes, where you can afford to be a little imprecise.  The skinnier brushes are slightly less useful to me, but on the other hand there have been plenty of times when I just need a clean eyeshadow blending brush, and have a couple of spares on hand means I don't have to stop everything to cleanse my shadow brush on the spot.  I don't have any trouble recommending this set to anyone--it's cute and functional.  So what if its not heirloom quality?",As Pretty As The Product Images Show,"RUIMIO Makeup Brush 10-Piece Foundation Brush for Makeup Application, Blending, Highlighting and Contouring"

I used about 3-4 pumps and put it on my face and neck, the serum dries fast and smells really nice, not overpowering but nice. I have used several different products from Valentia and have not been disappointed yet. One of the ingredients is Argan oil, which I love for body and hair, the Gotu Kola which reduces the appearance of scars, and one that I never thought of is Licorice which can lighten problem areas of the skin such as discolorization.

While the scent for this mist is decent and works nicely with the Bum Bum Cream, I'm not sure where you're getting this beach smell, and more importantly, the scent fails to last. The cream on its own is what carries the scent -- with or without the fragrance mist, the cream's scent is strong. The mist adds a nice whiff initially but that's about it.

Frankly, there are way too many nice body mists to try out for me to buy this again, but if you're religious about Bum Bum Cream, then I suggest you stay with this because the fragrance in the cream is such that it won't really meld with many other perfumes.

I'm enjoying using the BBC and this mist, generally speaking, but neither product is really worth the price tag.

5.0,A3TWPW6C78JPGV,B01B5GTUM6,"I have a variety of Radha products, ranging from beauty to home/bath products, and my experience has sometimes been a little hit or miss.  (Big hit = Cool Mist Diffuser.  Big miss = Cellulite Cream.) So I was slightly apprehensive when I was offered this product for free in exchange for a candid review, especially since I'm a scientist, and I'm tough when it comes to grading.  But this one earns 5 stars, for the simple face that it does what I need it to do, which is condition and soften my hair in way that leaves it shiny and un-frizzy.

For reference I have waist-length, healthy hair---each hair is very fine, but I have a billion of them, and they easily blow around my face in breeze because they're so lightweight.  So I want something that weighs my hair down, which I admit is probably not what most people are aiming for; but in order for my hair to hang nicely in a shiny sheet, it needs the right kind of moisture coating to temporarily smooth the cuticle and allow it to drape properly.

This conditioner is pretty rich---and it does smell like coconuts, but only faintly, which is fine with me.  I have to use quite a lot (like a handful) so this jar isn't going to last long, but then again, I have hair to my waist.  FYI:  this is not an instant conditioner.  It definitely needs a few minutes to work.  I didn't get out of the shower or anything (Who's patient enough to take a two-part shower in order to do a lengthy hair mask? Am I right?) but I did leave to sit in my hair for 4 minutes while I shaved my legs!  The good news is that it *does* leave your hair shiny.  I wouldn't say it leaves my hair softer than a drugstore brand, but I can get a brush through it pretty easily.

Now for the bad news.  I compare the ingredients of EVERY beauty and bath product I use against databases of comedogenicity (i.e. how easily these ingredients cause breakouts.)  This is because I live in San Francisco, where the water is very hard, and the dissolved minerals combine with skin oils, and comedogenic ingredients to form an invisible pore-clogging soap scum.  So I do my homework (and it's exhausting.......)  If you have acne-prone skin, let me share the findings so you don't have to do as much work as I did.  The online database acnemantra.com returned the following results:
----------
Found 4 acne causing ingredients:
Shea Butter is comedogenic
Argan Oil is comedogenic
Rosehip Seed Oil is mildly comedogenic
Coconut Oil is highly comedogenic

If you're surprised to see coconut oil on that list, well...it's true.  Coconut oil is highly comedogenic and will cause breakouts if you have large pores that block at the drop of a hat.  I know some people rave about it, but they probably have dry skin and small pores.  The rest of us need to be very careful, because even a single comedogenic ingredient can spell disaster.  This one has four of them.  So you might be playing with fire.  It just depends what type of skin you have.  I think this is a good conditioner--I just need to be very careful to rinse twice, and not let any residue stay on my scalp, face, or body.  If you don't have acne-prone skin--then this is an even better fit for you.

4.0,AJ9ZYMEUY14AX,B01B5GTUM6,"This is a good and nourishing hair mask. If I use it more than once a week, my hair starts to look a little greasy, but if I use it once every 10 days, I get a nice sheen of hair with no greasy look whatsoever. The product comes in a plastic tub about the size of a 12 oz tub of butter. Each time I use the product, I use about 2 tablespoons specifically focusing on the ends of my hair. I have super long hair, almost 42 inches long! It reaches past my hips to my glutes. I focus on the hair at my shoulders and all the way down. I have split ends that need to be trimmed, but this is a great maintenence product while I wait to get my hair done again. It helps the appearance of thinning and split ends at the end of my hair shafts. It does not ""reseal"" or repair split ends, but it does help the hair look thicker where it starts to thin due to the slit ends. The product is smooth and easy to work through the hair. A little goes a long way, and this product isn't even a quarter gone, and I have been using it for about 3 months once every 10 days. The smell is great, very tropical, and the smell stays on the hair. I have gotten compliments, and people have asked me what product I am using due to the smell alone. It is a nice hair mask that goes a long way. I use it about 20 minutes before showering on dry hair, and then I wash it out and let my hair air dry.

5.0,AON853FSY8RNJ,B01B5GTUM6,"&nbsp;I am on a complete coconut kick.  It offers so many benefits.  Currently I am using a coconut infused shampoo and conditioner that has worked wonders and I wanted to add a coconut deep conditioner / mask to round out my hair care routine.

I have processed hair and it is damaged from a bad color job so I experience a lot of breakage.  The ends are weak and my hair is filled with split ends.  I can't afford deep conditioning treatments at the salon on top of getting my hair done, so an at home, do it myself treatment is perfect.

The container is a very generous size, 8 ounces.  Using this product once or twice a week I would imagine it would last a minimum of 3 months or more.  I opened the container and took of the seal and was immediately overjoyed and the yummy coconut smell.  The directions state to apply to hair after shampooing and leave on for 5 to 20 minutes.  I applied this mask in the shower after I shampooed my hair so I was only able to leave it on for about 5 minutes.  I rinsed it thoroughly.  When I dried my hair I was happy to discover that my hair wasn't greasy and the product didn't leave any residue.  Some masks can leave hair feeling greasy like it needs to be washed again.  The product itself is lightweight, like a normal conditioner.  It's not a heavy ""mask"".

Typically after I blow my hair dry, the ends are very frazzled, my split ends show and my hair just looks gross.  You can see in the video that my hair looks healthier and hydrated, definitely more nourished.

I am very excited to see what kind of results I will have after I use it a few more times.  This is a great alternative to expensive treatments.

4.0,A2EXGRAA6QW96Z,B01BCR38IU,"If you hate dying your hair, and if you like to go as long as possible between dye jobs, this product might be for you.

A friend recently told me about Dexe Root Touch Up, I ordered it immediately, and I've used it several times. There's still plenty more left in the box, too, so I plan to go a very long time (three to four months -- maybe longer) before I dye my hair again. (Then again, if I had an important function to attend, I would dye my hair and not depend on this!)

Certain parts show more than an inch of gray -- where my hair is parted, of course and at the crown toward the back. It takes about a minute to cover those areas. Gray at the temples and in front of the ears is a little trickier because, even using the narrow part of the brush, the black waxy-talc substance gets on my skin. It looks like soot. Fortunately, it wipes right off my skin with a dry washcloth, while remaining on the hair. My hair is now very silvery, very white in some places and fairly coarse. This still covers it well and doesn't stand out too differently from the rest of my hair which is dyed with VS Sassoon Salonist Neutral Black #1/0.

I do see a little residue on my pillow case. I have to reapply this after shampooing. It does lend a certain ""matte"" or dull feel to hair where it has been applied.

5.0,A2T0A3DUB6M3O2,B01BL54RPQ,"When I first opened the box I noticed the floral aroma right away. It smelled drop dead gorgeous.

Hard to choose so I picked the one I am most familiar with, ""So Pretty"" which contains ylang ylang, geranium, lavender and lemon oil. The bath bomb has an off white color. The rose petals are yet visible until you drop the bath bomb in water for a couple seconds. The petals are are not whole pieces but in smaller chunks. The amount of the rose petals are not a lot either which was kind of disappointing.
As for the scent of the bath bomb from the essential oil, it was very soothing and pleasing. There is no synthetic fragrance so the scent was very naturally and not overwhelming at all. I really enjoy sitting in the tub for longer than usual.

After getting out of the tub, I immediately regretted my decision so I stayed a little longer. When I got out of the tub for good I wrapped myself up and I notice the floral scent in my hair. I was so delighted. That was a good indulgence :)

It promises to fortify weak spots on enamel and helps to reduce plaque buildup with regular brushing.  It also freshens breathe.  It does not have whitening properties, which is the only reason I deducted a star.

It is a very thick full coverage cream foundation that can look unnatural and pasty if too much is applied at once. Out of the tube it may not feel easily spreadable, I find that adding a drop of oil (any facial oil) and mixing it in your palm will make an easier application. It is best to build up coverage gradually rather than trying to achieve full coverage in one shot. I found using a foundation brush worked best. I would recommend using a primer and setting with a finely milled translucent powder. In terms of color, I would recommend that you view as many swatches online as you can. The numbering system is not necessarily indicative of shade gradation from light to dark. Some shades have much more pink undertones than others. This has SPF 30 which I like; some may find that a negative due to photographic flashback.

5.0,A3TWPW6C78JPGV,B01C29P4I4,"I've bought a few sets of similar brushes on Amazon, and they're all basically the same thing.  There must be a single manufacturer or wholesale supplier, and then each seller rebrands them and distributes them as their own.  With that understanding though, these are still excellent.  The synthetic bristles do NOT drink up your foundation, so you don't lose liquid on application.  It's expensive to keep wasting foundation that gets trapped in the brush and washed down the drain after every use.  Also, the bristles are cut evenly, so all the brush shapes look correct.  I've purchased at least one set where the bristles were cut so crookedly that it looked like someone assembled the brush while blindfolded.

Three things:

1.  I'm sure people are  going to complain about how the brush roll smells strongly synthetic when you open it up.  It does.  But it goes away almost immediately.  It's the same kind of smell that you find on a lot of new plastic items.  Remember the way it smells when you unpack a new TV or DVR?  It's like that.  After a few minutes, you wouldn't notice it unless you stuck your face in it.  After a few hours, it's essentially gone.

2.  There's no explanation as to what each brush is for.  That doesn't bother me a bit, since I can always find a good use for a clean brush.

3.  The great thing about this set is that they DO NOT have logos on the handles, as shown in the product images.  The set I received has matte black handles, with no writing at all---which just how I prefer them to be.  Logos are distracting.

FYI, there's no storage space for any other makeup items.  I think it would have been clever to add a small zip pocket on the back of the brush roll, but I know that would have been potentially bulky and inconvenient.

Bottom line:  this was a great purchase.  I'm happy with this set, and I actually prefer to use these over my far more expensive Sephora brushes.  If I had known about these brushes before paying so much money for the Sephora brand, I would have bought these first.  They're soft, dense, they dry quickly after washing, and the bristles don't suck up all your foundation.  That's as good as it gets.

5.0,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B01CHS3CHA,"This kit contains a selection of six tools for extracting comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and pustules (pimples) as well as splinters and thorns, plus a dentists mirror.  A zippered storage case is included.

The tools vary from about 4 1/4 to 5 3/16 in. long.  Some are rounded with knurling, some have square sections, and one is flat, but they are all easy to grip and handle.

A couple of the tools are similar, but this is a good assortment.  One extractor has flat rings rather than the ubiquitous spoon or cup tips and I find that they are easier to center on small blemishes because a spoon tip hides the pore.

They are made of stainless steel so that they can be sanitized after use with rubbing alcohol or a mild bleach solution.  They could also be autoclaved.

Professional tools like these make it easy to take care of blemishes with damaging the surrounding skin and causing infection and scarring.  To learn how to use these them, read the instruction pamphlet thats included and watch videos on YouTube submitted by doctors like Vikram Yadav or Sandra Lee.

2.0,AON853FSY8RNJ,B01CJOHL5G,"I suffer from thinning eye brows that have to be filled in and drawn on.  They are sparse to begin with and stop growing about half way above my eye.  Drawing them on and filling them in can be so time consuming and it's hard to get them on just right so I thought this would be a great option.

I was skeptical because they are tattoos and tattoos can be tricky to apply.  I really wanted to like this product because I think it's a great concept and it seems so easy, but I had a very trying time.  The first step is to cut out the tattoo as close to the eyebrow as possible.  This was tricky.  Once I held it up to my eyebrow I could tell it would be unnaturally long so I had to trim excess and then trim the other eyebrow to match.  It took me several attempts to get one on.  I don't know if my washcloth wasn't wet enough or if I have too much hair for the tattoo to stick too but application was too much for me.  Then to try and apply the other side and make sure it matches was even more tough.  I was able to apply and wear for 2 days but I felt self conscious the entire time.

As painstaking as filling my eyebrows in is, that's what I'm going to stick to.

3.0,A3TWPW6C78JPGV,B01D5G7PB2,"I have been critical of this brand in the past, and remain so now.  I am going to repeat the concerns that I've previously shared in the context of the 50% Lactic Acid Peel, because the issues still exist.

1.) There's no credible information.  No website, no record of Dr. Song, no record that ""Dr Song"" possesses medical training. Googling yields only a skimpy myshopify page with just 3 products, NONE of which is this face wash.  On the About Us page, there's only vague mention of it being a global pharmaceutical company, using pharmaceutical grade ingredients.  And yet, the only way to contact them is a single email address.  Any reputable company providing consumers with ""pharmaceutical-grade"" anything would have at least one support hotline for customers in case of adverse reaction or usage questions.

2.)  If this indeed contains 10% Benzoyl Peroxide,  then it sounds awfully high, as if it should be administered by a professional, and not by unskilled individuals without the benefit of any customer support resources.  Even the respected Murad brand doesn't go higher than 3.5%, and La Roche Posay and DDF top out at ~5%.  And all of those brands have trusted websites, customer hotlines, and prominently posted Hours of Operation.

3.)  Given the lack of credible information, it seems foolhardy to play with ""pharmaceutical grade"" products. However, as a person with very oily skin, I gamely gave this product a try.  The texture is thin and creamy, and it doesn't foam.  The smell is not great. It cleans well, but is very drying, to the point of leaving skin flaky. It takes some effort to rinse.  And you DO want to rinse twice.  Since I posed a question to the Q&A section, and got only a half-correct answer, I will answer myself right here:  Yes, any residual product *will* bleach clothing, pillowcases, and hair ON CONTACT.  How do I know this?  Because it unequivocally says so right on the bottle.  So that's a specific risk and opportunity cost for dark haired people, and it would have been good to be clear about that upfront in the product information.

So once again, having no other information to go on, it would be reckless to give this product more than 3 stars.  If you don't have sensitive skin, and have a devil-may-care attitude toward medical qualifications, then maybe this face wash works for you.  For me, it's risky and not particularly a joy to use, however, I can see trying it on less sensitive areas such as the upper back region.

They are just a little bit more dense, but they are the perfect size, maybe a little bit larger than the Beauty Blender.  Anyway, these are really easy to use, because they are more dense I don't find they suck up as much foundation as my other sponges, so they are less wasteful.  They are easy to wash out (I wash them with soap and water after each use) and they are always dry by the next morning when I use use them again.  They haven't bled much color.  Although I did let them soak in rubbing alcohol after I got them to make them bleed as much as they could, but now when I use them and wash them after they don't bleed pink or purple very much if at all.  Overall I'm very pleased with these sponges, especially to get 2 this size for $6.99 (the price at the time I am posting this) - is a great price.  Very pleased.

5.0,A2LAS014NSRW72,B01DEDYWD0,"I didn't know what to expect as I hadn't used this brand before. But serums being all the rage, I wanted to try it.

Serum is another word for light, smooth, and instantly absorbing oil. It's not really an oil but lotion doesn't make sense either. It's just a lovely few drops (you hardly use any) and it spreads all over your face and soaks in. You do not look greasy at all.  It's also not considered a moisturizer so you still need to moisturize.

My guess is that (pretend I took chemistry) the molecules or whatever that make this up are somehow smaller than lotion ones. So this goes on first, fills in the pores, leaves an even finish, almost like primer for your foundation. That's my uneducated guess. Because when you put on your lotion for night or day over this, it goes on smoother, you use less, and it feels like your face is smooth and also just a bit more hydrated.

Now, I grew up with a mom who slathered herself in Avon's night cream so much that I can barely stand anything Avon today. Just wore it like crazy and her pillowcase would crinkle after a day or two when that gunk dried.  This didn't show on my pillow case at all. It's completely absorbed, even with my Vichy night cream on top.  The bonus is, my kids can kiss me goodnight without being covered with Avon.

My big likes are that you don't use but a few drops, there's no fragrance issues, and it doesn't pill under foundation like some serums do during the day.

And best of all, my skin feels plumper and smooth: the only time it's okay to be plump in our society.

I rec'd a sample to consider for review. Positive reviews are not guaranteed and run the range from from one star to five stars, despite getting the sample item.  This is five star.",Softness absorbed,Essential Oil Blend Anti Aging Serum for Skin
5.0,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B01DEDYWD0,"If you are looking for something to make your skin look super healthy, toned and vibrant this is a good option if you are used to using serums. I have been using this for two weeks now and found the best way to apply it is to add a drop or two to my regular face cream, then apply. Otherwise you get a sort of yellow tanned look that takes a bit to rub in and disappear. I found using it along with the face cream was the fastest and easiest way to apply it.

The oil is sort of yellow like a turmeric oil and contains rosehip, neroli, chamomile, rose, frankincense, lavender, and bisalolol essential oils. So you can see how healing this also is. I don't notice any scent from the oil it seems relatively mild. I think this bottle is going to last me a long time since I use so little of it. The results are great (including smaller pores!) and I'm happy I tried this product. It is a time saver since I don't have to blend my own oils.

4.0,AJ9ZYMEUY14AX,B01DGWYQCG,"I like this scrub, as it helped me exfoliate my face and seemed to clear up my face and make it look younger while smelling awesome. I like the use of the product but mine came leaking.

I am totally partial to any grapefruit scent, and this product falls into line with my grapefruit obsession. It smells fabulous and leaves a scent on the skin, just what I like! It is a salty scrubber. I patted my face with water, placed a teaspoon of the scrub in my hands and scrubbed gently in little circles. It took about 30 seconds for the salty mixture to dissolve. I then washed off with warm water. I was nervous to do this multiple times because I had open acne with and without scabs. I thought that it would cause my acne to spread but it did not. The acne actually cleared up 50% after 3 uses of this product and did not further  spread. I followed the scrub with a cleanse, some toner, serum, and moisturizer. I looked in the mirror with good lighting after doing my makeup and noticed that my skin was smoother and I did look a few years younger. I had not exfoliated my face in 2 months prior to this, so I had some excess dead skin on my face. I am happy that my skin smelled good and that my acne seemed to clear up a little, and that I looked  slightly younger because of the exfoliation. The product did leave an oily residue on my face, so I did have to cleanse before and after use to make sure I didn't have any oil on my face clogging my pores. Product came leaky and opened.

4.0,A3TWPW6C78JPGV,B01DL917R6,"These are better than some other HBY headbands I tried, which were made of shiny spandex, and weren't stitched well.  These are actually made from a cotton blend jersey knit, which grips my hair better.  The seams are all good, and unlike the spandex headbands, which had GLUED ON tags, these have sewn in tags.  So the overall quality is much better, and the headbands are more comfortable to wear.  I received 3 black and 2 grey, as pictured in the product image.

The product description says these are 5 inches wide, but they're really closer to 4.5 inches, not that it matters to me.  The diameter is 8 inches. I have really smooth, slippery hair, so these headbands don't stay on all that well, but they still work for my purposes, since I use them to push my hair back when I wash my face.  I've tried to sleep in them so that my hair is away from my face (which helps avoid breakouts) but they don't stay on very well.  They end up around my neck or somewhere on the pillow!

I'd love to be able to wear these for running, but they won't stay on my smooth head of hair---but I'm guessing people who have more hair texture won't have a problem.  If you're looking for a sure-grip headband, you might need to keep looking, but if you're just looking for a wide, comfortable headband that won't leave hard dent marks in your hair, these aren't bad.

I love Essie nail polish, I have a nice size collection of the regular polish. I also love gel nail polish - I have my own tools (LED light).

Standard nail polish never lasts more than 24 hours on my fingernail no matter what I do. Therefore I was excited to try the 2 step polish that requires no LED light but resembles Gel Polish and a hopes for a 14 day wear.

I did two test runs:

Test 1:
Did no nail prep -I just followed directions, two coats of color, one coat of top.  Dries quickly, leaves great gloss

Day 1: Looks great
Day 2: Very small chipping to start on dominate hand
Day 3: Removed: Chipping on 85% of nails

Test 2:
I removed all the polish and prep my nails this time just as I would with doing real GELs. (Push back cuticle, buff nail to remove shine, cleans, add dehydrator, two coats color, one coat of top.

Day 1-2: Looks great, the shine lasted
Day 3: Chipping starting on dominate hand
Day 4: Removed

Granted, I did get a longer wear out of this polish than I have my typical Essie nail polish (or any brand for that matter).  I just have a naturally oil nail bed, but doing some of the prep-work I was able to get one more extra day of the polish.  So this is defiantly an improvement!

And this is one of the absolute best top coats out there, at any price. The only way to get a better one, in my opinion, is if you use a UV gel, and who wants to spend nearly 20 minutes soaking in pure acetone in order to remove a UV gel?
I find that this polish and topcoat removes quickly with acetone, and less quickly with a non acetone polish remover.
The top coat also makes any little streaks or flaws in the polish disappear.",Rockin' your Mani,essie Gel Couture Nail Polish
5.0,A2CZ98V784SRJ0,B01E7UKR38,"Rock the Runway is a simple, all purpose classic, pure bright but not overly-bright red. A Crayola red. A sharp choice for Christmas, Fourth of July, or even Valentine's Day. Creamy, opaque, quick drying and long wearing.  Just a great one.

All Essie's are great.  I wear them almost exclusively as they are almost the only thing that wears above a day on my crazy nails.  I can typically get about a week with any Essie (and I can go beyond that with their gel couture).  I do reapply top coat every 2nd or third day.

The Gel Couture polishes are a thicker more gelly like formula than the ""regular"" Essies.  They I also have a wider brush, but it's so nicely tapered that it's easy to work with.  I would recommend the ""Regular"" Essies if you want to do nail art, but for regular one-color wear, either formula is nice.  The Gel Couture line does wear a little longer, but I'm typically ready to change colors before I reach their maximum wear time.

One of my favorite aspects of Essie is that its very forgiving if you happen to be prone to messing up your nails.  They dry quickly once the top coat is on (the color is a little more vulnerable to marring before the  top coat is applied), and as they dry they self-level to give you a smooth glassy surface even if your technique (like mine) is imperfect.

The Gel Couture line really requires the matching top coat to get its wear time, but I use that top coat over other Essies quite often as well.

My Essie collection is approaching 100 bottles and my obsession shows no signs of abating.  I did receive this bottle free to review, however I routinely purchase these polishes with my own money.

I received a pinkish beige color called fairy tailor.  This shade almost matches my skin tone but it shows up because of the subtle variation in tone but also because of how it shines.  I'm applied two coats letting them dry before adding the top coat which added even more shine.

The bottles with their twisted silorite looks space agish but also makes them easy to hang on to.  My polish tends to show the most wear at the top of my nails where it rubs off.  After several days there's no sign of this.

5.0,A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M,B01E7UKR38,"Set aside about forty minutes and take your time with this. So, I waited for my favorite tv show to come on (so I wouldn't be tempted to walk around while waiting for my toes to dry) and began. In total, this is a three step process: apply a coat of color and wait, apply a second coat of color and wait, and finally apply the gel coat and wait. If you take your time, the end product is lovely! Nice color and super shiny!

Now, I know you might be tempted to use a heavier layer of color and then a heavier layer of color for a super rich look. Avoid this. By following the directions and using two regular coats, you are going to get a less streaky and more uniform color. Trust me, if you go a little heavy, it's going to take longer to dry and look clumpy. So, by going the easy route, the product is going to look its best. So, win-win!

This is a hearty polish! It does not chip easily and lasts over one week on fingernails and at least two on toenails! So, this is worth the price.

3.0,A3R9H6OKZHHRJD,B01E7UKR38,"This set contains a nail polish and a topcoat, which are meant to give the appearance of a gel manicure.  They are also supposed to provide the longevity of a gel manicure, without the need for a curing light or the difficult removal process.  The color I received, Beau-Tie, is a pretty deep purple creme.  It looks quite blue-leaning in the bottle, but is actually much warmer on the nail.  In any case, the color was pretty, and the polish did look nice on my nails.  The instructions say to use the polish on bare nails (no base coat), do two coats, and follow with a coat of topper.  I did this, and I did have a nice, shiny manicure.  The shine was obvious, but I'm not convinced that it's anything exclusive to Essie.  There are other topcoats that will give you a similar appearance.  This polish definitely did not last the two weeks that the package claimed it would.  I found it lasted for about as long as any other polish when worn with a good topcoat- about four days.  The bigger issue, for me, is that without a base coat, my nails were in rough shape when this polish started chipping and I removed it.  They've been weak, peeling, and splitting.  The result is that I won't be wearing this without base coat again.  The bigger takeaway is that I don't find this to be fundamentally different from other nail polishes.  The ""gel couture"" business seems like a gimmick.  Also, I'm accustomed to using a quick dry topcoat, and this one takes much longer.  Be advised!","Pretty, but really not gel-like",essie Gel Couture Nail Polish
5.0,A2CZ98V784SRJ0,B01E7UKR38,"I **LOVE** my Essies.  They are by far my favorite nail polish brand (and one of only two brands I will buy--only others are impossible on my nails).  Even though I have less-than-stellar technique and I am admittedly horribly hard on my nails, with Essie I can keep my nails looking professionally manicured without chips, redos, or drama. I am loyal to this brand for a reason!

WEAR TIME:  I'm fairly new to the Gel Couture line, though I've worn the classic Essie polishes for much longer.  I wondered how these would compare to my regular Essie routing (which is, Grow Stronger base coat, 2 coats of color, followed by Good to Go top coat), and I was astounded to find they compare very, very favorably.  I swear by Essie base coat, but was impressed that Gel Couture performed equally well with and without it.  (I do still like using it for a treatment layer and to prevent nail discoloration overtime; with Gel Couture I noticed no difference in wear time with or without base coat, though base coat  is a game changer with the classic Essies).  With my classic Essie colors, I tend to get about a week of wear, but do reapply top coat intermittently during the week (my goal is always every other day, but I usually forget pretty often).  In testing these out, I resisted reapplying top coat AT ALL, so that I could get a sense of how they wore on one application.  I'm quite impressed.  I got 11 days of wear, with a small few chips coming of the 11th or 12th day (depending on the shade).  I'm more than satisfied with that, given that I'm ridiculously hard on my nails and don't own a dishwasher.  Also, aside from Essie, I've found (at any price point) that there's only one other brand that doesn't chip within 24 hours (I can usually get 4 or 5 days with Revlon, so it's my second choice).  I went from a week with ""regular"" Essie to almost TWO weeks with these.  These last well past the point where I want to change my polish colors.

COLOR APPLICATION:  I've tried 7 of these Gala Bolds (as well as some from the original release and all but two of the Ballet Nudes), and I would say that with the exception of ONE shade, all of these polishes are dreamy to work with.  These are slightly thicker, more jelly like consistency than the classic Essies.  They are smooth and self leveling, apply like butter and look as smooth as satin.  The drip-free brush has a fabulous contour, so even working on my small nails, the wider brush was not an issue.  Most shades were opaque in one coat (but I'm a two coat girl, so I went for two anyway).  As Essie herself says, they ""Go on like silk and wear like Iron.""  The one color with a less stellar experience was ""Wearing Hue"" and if you sort Amazon reviews by color (yup, that's possible) you'll notice that most of the few negative reviews relate to that shade.  It's not an impossible shade, and milky opaque pastel colors are the more ""struggle-some"" colors in any range.  However, I did need a third coat to get to opaque and needed be more careful about not overflowing the nail bed. It still self leveled and wore beautifully.  I'd give this one shade 4 stars, but the others deserve more than 5.

(And anytime you are working with Essie, be patient with your perceived mistakes; give them a moment, they will self level and look as smooth as a calm sea even if you thought your application wasn't perfect.  They may be magic.)

TOP COAT:  I've taken to using this top coat with regular Essies instead of my Good to Go top coat.  There's magic in this bottle. Instead of getting 6-7 days with classic Essies, I can get more (though, I rarely want to, as I like to change my nail colors.)  With this top coat on Gel Couture, I am seeing 11 days!  Also, though I reapplied the Good to Go throughout the week, I don't feel the need to reapply with this one.  The Good to Go MIGHT stay a little (tiny bit) shinier through the week, but that's a hard call.  Though both wear well, this is my favorite.  Both dry super fast.  Like, ridiculously fast.  (I am currently testing the Gel Setter one, so I can't compare it yet.)  You do need to use this top coat with the Gel Couture polishes (or they won't last), however it's nice that it will work with traditional Essies as well.

I called Essie about this Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat, since I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be an improvement on the Gel Couture Top Coat (which is what it was called in the initial release of this line).  Essie has FABULOUS customer service, and they were able to confirm that it was a rebranding, and Gel Couture Top Coat and Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat are the same thing, just slightly rebranded.  (Not to be confused with the Gel Setter top coat, which IS different, and is NOT the one to use with this line.)

I can never recommend Essie enough.  They changed my nail game.  When I was almost ready to give up because fixing my nails took soooo long to do and to dry and I was getting so frustrated with fixing my mistakes, I discovered Essie.  They are MAGIC, I tell you.  They dry to a pro finish in spite of weak skills, and before I have a chance to screw them up.  And they stay on my impossible nails.  There's nothing remotely as good.

This one is a lovely slightly violet polish in the red range. It's perfect for people like me who wear a lot of cool colors and have blue based coloring. The color in the bottle looks exactly like one in the photo on my screen, and slightly more red when it dried on my nails. I like it a lot. This color glides on very easily and almost covers in one coat. I did have to use a second coat to completely cover all the little spots that I missed the first time around. The polish looks good on its own, but the gel topcoat really sets it off. It gives my nails a hard, very shiny finish and helps to protect the manicure. It also smoothes out any imperfections that may have occurred when applying the first two coats. Don't skip it! The topcoat can also be worn on its own over bare nails for a nice shiny, finished look. But with so many beautiful Essie colors, why would you want to?

This polish was still going strong with only a hint of wear on the tip of one nail after 7 days. The top coat was still extremely shiny. My nails show growth at the base of the nail, so I usually change polish after 7 days. But if not for that, I probably could have gotten another couple days out of this polish.

5.0,A2YKWYC3WQJX5J,B01E7UKR38,"If I could give this duo six stars, I would. The combination of these two is, without a doubt, the best offering essie has ever put out there.

First of all, I hate it when you get a cream polish and it takes three or four coats in order to get it to look opaque. There was so much pigmentation in this nail polish that I could have gotten by with just one coat, although I put on two. The photograph shows the two coats on my hand.
After doing one hand, the polish started to thicken up a little on my second hand. I've noticed that this often happens with quick dry formulas. No problem, I just wait a minute and then reshake the bottle.
If you don't do that, it can come out thick, which makes it a little streaky or textured. Even if that's the case, all of those imperfections disappear when you apply this magical top coat. No, I'm not exaggerating. It really is Magic.
It evens the color and gives you a perfect shine that lasts for days and days.

And here is the part that I want to shout out... If all of the above weren't enough to make you really love this stuff, hold on because there's more.
I have long complained that I don't like the Essie nail polish brushes. They're great if you have small and short nails, in my opinion, but not for me.
The brush has a perfect curve that matches the base of your nail, and it's wider so that with three strokes, middle side, and side, you are DONE. The brush holds just the right amount of polish.
This review is for the VIPlease color. I think of it as a hibiscus or raspberry shade.
It looks great when you're wearing blue, pink, and even certain shades of burgundy. It's absolutely stunning with tropical prints that include flowers and greenery.
Getting the kit is a great way to try the top coat.
If your experience is as good as mine, this will be the only topcoat you ever use from now on.",The. Best. Ever.,essie Gel Couture Nail Polish

4.0,A914TQVHI872U,B01E7UKR38,"Review update:

While Essie states 'up to 14 days', one has to assess what effects those 14 days.

First off, this is an extremely pale opaque white with a hint of pink.

Application will require 3 even light coats of this shade, followed by its top coat.  Let dry thoroughly between.  Not quite the gel shine tho.

This color is pale, which could account for results.

This polish will hold up well for two or three days if nails are protected somewhat. It will show signs of wear and small chipping at nail tips. It can be touched up effectively.",Wearing hue?,essie Gel Couture Nail Polish

This time, I tried the Essie polish and top coat kit. I have color ""Inside Scoop"" which is a light pink that looks even lighter when applied. The pink has slight orchid undertones. It looks polished and not too sweet.  It goes on easily and the topcoat dries and protects.

This particular set Is called Beau-tie. It is a rich Amethyst color, and is a spectacular color. My 13 year old granddaughter was visiting me, and we gave each other mani pedis. We soaked our feet in water, washed and dried, and then filed the toenails. We applied a clear base coat. Two layers of this amethyst color and finally the top coat. Glossy and shiny results. On to the manicure, soaked our nails in mild soap and water, dried and filed our nails. Again, the same base coat. Two layers of the amethyst color and finally the top coat. We are a blazing color duo. I am usually more conservative in my colors, but I just love this amethyst on my toes and nails. We have received compliments, and people have requested the color and make of the polish.

So far this mani-pedi has lasted a week, with good results. One chip on my granddaughter's little toenail where she tripped on a stone. We both give this nail polish and color five stars!

5.0,AOTMP0OKJOUWI,B01EGH00J8,"The movie came out. I work in an elementary school and am surrounded by kids constantly, so naturally I have to go see the cool (and quality) movies that excite the kids (and this one looked pretty good.) So I went to the theatre and thoroughly enjoyed the enchanting story and incredible imagination. So no disrepect to those aspects of the movie whatsoever.

BUT I firmly believe this movie would have not been what it was without the score. I can't remember the time I had heard a score that so well matched the story and emotion of a film. This movie is loosely based on a children's book and I think the music somehow brought along that literary magic. Just listen to the music and you can tell more or less what part of the movie it is. I remember sitting in the theatre, stunned at how well this music supported the story.

Thus, I am calling this storybook music. It's sweet, simple, and all the while completely joyous/powerful/sad/whatever the occassion called for. A little Celtic touch completes the magic, not to mention those certain chords tying all the pieces together. I left the theatre believing the music was the best part of an already awesome movie and downloaded the album.

And here is an example of this music's power: My classroom, last week, was painted and recarpeted. This of course meant that moving back in was hell and at this time I still don't know where a quarter of my things are--including the CD player used for listening centers, story readings, and the five minutes after recess where I play instrumental music to calm down the kids. So instead I pulled out my music-playing phone and turned up the volume on this album. Every student who had seen the movie IMMEDIATELY recognized what the music was (and became very excited and defeated the purpose of the calming down period).

If squirrly first graders are touched enough by this music to recognize it, well, I can't tell you a more powerful testimony.",Pure storybook wonder music,How To Train Your Dragon - Record Store Day 2016 Exclusive

Two of them are excellent--the smaller ones which measure 0.75 inch in length.  But the other two have very long blades--1.25 inches--which means that they're dangerously difficult to control.  I don't mean dangerous as in deadly, but dangerous as in imprecise.  If you're shaving sideburns this might not be a problem, but I'd be too scared to put a blade this long near my eyebrow.  One false move, and you could be missing a huge patch of hairs!  If you don't have the steady hands of a surgeon, I wouldn't recommend using the long blades on your face.  The short blades are a lot easier to handle, and block less of your view.

So you just have to use the right tool for the job.  If you need to do fine detailing, definitely stick to the small blades, and save the large blades for non-face areas!

5.0,A2XZM64TLWL34O,B01GQKM0AK,"Retinal has been proven to slow down the breakdown of collagen in skin and reduce dark spots. After using Retinol products for several months, I can say for certain it is producing noticeable improvement for my skin. The hyper-pigmentation between my eye brows has faded significantly and fine lines are smoothing out. This is a good quality anti-aging moisturizer containing the most Retinol (2.5%) I have seen in a skin care product without a prescription. From my personal experience, Retinol has been the best choice for my sun damaged skin since it has helped improve my discoloration and skin texture.

I like the fact that it is made with organic and natural ingredients which is something I look for in any facial skincare product. The ingredients included in this product such as organic Aloe Vera, Vitamin E, organic Jojoba oil and green tea are great for skincare, especially for the elasticity and collagen boosting. There are no added fragrances or colors to aggravate my sensitive skin and nose. I love the unique pump design as it protects active ingredients from sunlight and oxygen not to mention it makes for easy application. One pump will generate enough product for my face and neck. There is no more dipping unsanitary fingers into the jar to potentially contaminate the product. I appreciate the inclusion of an expiration date as well.

Due to the high amount of Retinol as indicated, I start out using this cream once a day in order not to dry out my skin, then gradually increase my application of it to twice a day. This moisturizer absorbs into the skin quick and well within minutes leaving a smooth surface which can be used as makeup primer. It does not leave a greasy feel or impact my foundation when applied. It is comfortable enough to be worn in warm weather without getting sticky or making me feel sweaty. This moisturizer makes my face feel well hydrated and nourished when I apply this cream at night after my toner and Vitamin C serum. I have sensitive skin, but this product does not cause any breakouts or negative reactions. It makes my skin feel much smoother and firmer than it ever has before.

I don't know if it's the ""Quardra Action"" or not, but it consistently gives a comfortable, smooth shave.  Moreover, it's quieter, gives a closer shave, and is more comfortable to hold compared to more moderately priced shavers.  The Norelco 6826XL is also easier to clean: Shake it out in the trash, then rinse under tap water.  Occasionally, you might want to manually clean the cutters with the included brush.
The Norelco recharges quickly (a few hours for full recharging, several minutes for a quick one), has a nice solid feeling, and is angled for a more ergonomic experience.  Furthermore, the money-back guarantee appears to be the real thing; you can't lose on this one. The shaver stops fairly soon when the battery is almost used-up; there's really no need for the more expensive models that have a charge indicator light.

5.0,A1SYLII0808HD6,B000050B63,"I've had this shaver for several months now and am very impressed with its performance.  I don't know if it's the ""Quardra Action"" or not, but it consistently gives a comfortable, smooth shave.  Moreover, it's quieter, gives a closer shave, and is more comfortable to hold compared to more moderately priced shavers.  The Norelco 6826XL is also easier to clean: Shake it out in the trash, then rinse under tap water.  Occasionally, you might want to manually clean the cutters with the included brush.
The Norelco recharges quickly (a few hours for full recharging, several minutes for a quick one), has a nice solid feeling, and is angled for a more ergonomic experience.  Furthermore, the money-back guarantee appears to be the real thing; you can't lose on this one. The shaver stops fairly soon when the battery is almost used-up; there's really no need for the more expensive models that have a charge indicator light.

4.0,A1UBUX7VM3QC9N,B000068PBK,"I bought this shaver a while ago, but I wanted to wait at least a month before writing my review, since it's supposed to take about that long before your face is used to an electric razor.
This is my first electric, and I was concerned going into it. I looked at the price of good standard blades, though, and saw how quickly an electric razor would pay for itself. I'll never go back. For the first week, the shave was not as close as I had become accustomed with using a blade. After that, though, I've gotten closer and closer shaves by the week. After a little more than a month of using the Spectra, my skin is now smooth even against the grain. I've gotten back to where I was with a blade.
The Pros:
- Shaving takes easily only half the time as it did with a straight razor.
- I can shave any time, any where. With a blade, if I tried to shave more than once per day, I'd cut myself all up into a bloody mess. With this electric, I do notice some discomfort after having shaved a second time in a day, but it gets a nice close shave. A little after shave takes care of the sting, and I'm good to go again.
- No mess. I really don't miss having to use shaving cream, even my nifty hot-lather shaving cream.
The Cons:
- Motor power seems to wind down a bit towards the end of the battery charge. It's not too bad, but it seems to take longer to shave at the end of the charge, and I don't want to charge it early for fear of damaging the battery.
- This is really a minor quibble, but I thought I'd mention it: Since this razor rinses clean under tap water, what few bits of hair are still left over are sitting in water over night. Every time I use the razor, for the first minute of shaving, it smells very strongly of old, wet hair.
Tips:
- Blade users: Apply less pressure than you're used to. I find I get a better shave when the razor is touching the skin firmly, noticibly, but not pressing in at all.
- Rinse it out every day, and turn the faucet up high. If you let it go a couple days without rinsing, it's much harder to clean out. It only takes a couple seconds, so why not?
- Shave daily. I find that if I let my beard get a little longer the shaver still does a pretty good job. However, there will always be a few hairs that grew too long, curling down, that are not lifted by the razor head. Just shave daily, when you only have stubble, to avoid this.
- Get a makeup mirror! These little mirrors are concave, magnifying your face so you can see where you've missed more easily. I mounted mine to the wall, slightly below my chin. Now I can more easily see if I've shaved my neck well.","Excellent, even for a blade-user",Norelco 8865XL Spectra Shaving System

I never really had acne in highschool but when I got college aged, I began breaking out on my face, chest and back. I went to a prominent dermatologist and this is one of the things he recommended I use. I'm in my 40's now and until recently I used this soap every day in the shower. I hadn't had any real break outs for years and years.

A bar of this soap generally lasted me a couple of months and I'd stocked up with several bars so hadn't bought any for approximately six months. When I ran out and went to buy more, I noticed the box was different but didn't think too much of it. Within a few days of using the soap in the new box, I knew something was very wrong. My face felt hot and itchy. It looked almost sunburned and the texture was sort of rough, like nothing I'd ever had before. I still happened to have one of the boxes of the old version of the soap and noticed the formulation was a 5% salicylic acid. I compared it to the new box and noted it's now made with a 5% benzoyl peroxide solution!

I called the company and was told that they had bought the Steiffel lab company in the fall of 2009 and would no longer be making the salicylic acid version of the soap.

I did some research and found that Clinique makes a similar .5% salicylic acid version so I bought two bars of it. I don't like it quite as much as my old standby but it's still very good and my face is back to normal. Unfortunately, it costs almost twice as much per bar but it's still less expensive than many other treatments out there, it's simple to use and it works so I feel it's a worthy investment.

I also found that Aveeno has a bar using salicylic acid called ""Clear Complexion Cleansing Bar"". It was very inexpensive and I noticed it's available in lots of different stores where I live. I bought a bar of it but haven't tried it yet. I'll try to remember to review it as soon as I have used it for a couple of weeks or so.

My advice: SKIP this new formulation of Panoxyl bar soap! It's harsh, smelly, and doesn't control breakouts. Honestly, this benzoyl peroxide version is the absolute worst thing I've ever used on my face. I didn't even want to leave the house for a few days after using this only about 3 times.",Formula Changed Sometime in the Fall/Winter 2009,PanOxyl Bar 5% - 1 bar

Method Hand Wash (lavender) is an ok soap in one of those pump bottles; unlike similar products, however, it claims no anti-bacterial effects.

Therefore 64 ounces divided by 4 equals only 16 treatments. So for me I have to use my own latex free wraps I bought else where. And I use my own nylon two piece rain suit because the so called free vinyl suit they supply is almost impossible to clean or keep clean and doubt if it launders through a washer. My inexpensive nylon pvc coated rain suit fits well and washes fine so it stays clean and I can move around as all elephants especially on the short side does not fit the free suit in this kit at all.

This shower gel is very thin and  watery but when I use scrubbing gloves in the shower or a loofah, there is no issues, as it foams up beautifully and  leaves the skin smooth and greatly scented. The smell itself is the best part, tangy lemonade and juicy red berries marry into a mouth watering cleanser that makes me feel like standing under a waterfall of summer. The bright and mouth watering luminous scent is amazing, and makes me want to wake up in the morning and get ready for another day.

I'm wearing Bogota Blackberry by OPI on my nails right now (a great deep burgundy color), but I'm aching to try this purple shade. I've seen it for a few weeks now on the toes of my Pilates instructor. She and I are both olive skin toned women of medium-dark coloring, and we carry deep tones well. This particular color she's been wearing--ie, Essie's Bermuda Shorts--looks nicer on toes than in the amazon pic. It's a strong purple that retains depth and brightness. And the fact that one pedicure has lasted her weeks (it's  now finally chipped and wearing off after nearly four weeks!) makes me want to try Essie for a change. (I've been a diehard OPI gal for years.)

So, I give the color a thumbs up for its compatibility with the season's color obession, and also for its plain old purple happy-joy-joy fun look. And for those of us who want quality, my observation of how this has endured on my dancer/excercise physiologist/Pilates expert trainer, who is constantly barefoot and using her toes, this is a great polish that wears nicely and lasts a loooooooong time.

3.0,ABLOQZIL42W7I,B0019ZD5Z2,"Crest Whitestrips-Daily Multicare Formula and Tartar Protection is designed for ""maintenance"" bleaching, to maintain the whiteness of your teeth once the desired shade has been reached. Therefore, one should use a Crest Strip product such as the entry-level system Classic Whitestrips&nbsp;Classic Whitestrips-Crest Dental Whitening System, 56 Strips, or a stronger product like Crest Whitestrips Premium&nbsp;Crest Whitestrips Premium- 7- Day Dental Whitening Formula System, 28 Strips&nbsp;before the Daily Multicare Formula with Tarar Inhibitor is used.

This product is used for just 5 minutes a day to maintain the whiteness of (previously) bleached teeth. (All the other Crest Whitestrip products advise a 30-minute treatment, once or twice a day protocol).  There are virtually no side-effects, such as sensitive teeth, or ""burned"" gums, as the contact time is just 5 minutes. This system has a 6% hydrogen peroxide gel, the same as Crest Classic Whitestrips. A tartar inhibitor is included for those who form tartar easily.

An alternative to this product of daily bleaching maintenance is to use one of the original systems again, such as Classic Whitestrips for 1-2 weeks to restore the bleach white color of the teeth.

Crest White Strips come in as many as 7 different formulations, which can be quite confusing to the consumer. Please remember the key difference in all these products is the strength of the hydrogen peroxide gel, and of course the price. The higher the dose of hydrogen peroxide, the faster the bleaching result, and the most costly as well. Here is a quick summary of the products:

1. Crest White Strips Classic. This is Crest's first bleaching product, introduced in 2001. It has a 6% hydrogen peroxide gel, and is applied twice a day for 30 minutes for 14-days of treatment. It is still a very popular product, and perhaps offers the lowest number of side-effects.

2. Crest White Strips Premium came out in 2004. It is a 10% hydrogen peroxide gel, applied twice a day for 30 minutes each session, for 7-days of treatment. The 10% hydrogen peroxide strength offers a quicker bleaching result, but perhaps with more tooth and gum sensitivity.

3. Crest Pro Effects came out in 2008. It is another 10% hydrogen peroxide gel, but offers a 10-day treatment protocol - again, twice a day for 30 minutes each time.

4. Crest Advanced Seal is the latest product (February, 2009), and it also has a 10% hydrogen peroxide, twice a day, 30-minutes a day, 10-day treatment. The main advantage to this system is that the strip is more adherent to the teeth, and the user can talk, exercise, drive, be active, even drink fluids, with the strip in place. The other systems advise the user to be stationary for the 30-minute treatment time.

5. Daily Whitening Multicare is another 6% hydrogen peroxide gel strip. It is used just 5-minutes/day.  The only difference between this product and the featured product is the lack of a tartar inhibitor.

In using any of the Crest bleaching products, please follow the specified instructions that come with each product.

Crest White Strip products work for the vast majority of people. Younger people with yellow stains seem to respond better than older people or those with gray stains. If you have severely stained teeth, especially those with tetracycline (an antibiotic) stain, the strips may not work well for you.

If you are not satisfied with the results and still want whiter teeth, you can then see your dentist for a more concentrated in-office form of bleaching (called ""power bleaching"").

I gave this product a 3-star rating, as I don't think the consumer needs a tartar-inhibitor in the bleaching agent. Normal everyday brushing and flossing should keep tartar away.

The lotion comes out a light peach color and it smells a bit of green tea.  It isn't very strong or like perfume; it is subtle, but the scent is there and it is nice.  The lotion has a slight bit of sheen to it, and is just a tad pearlized with mica, but not enough to make you glittery.

It goes on slick, and wet but absorbs in very quickly leaving only soft, smooth moisturized skin.  The moisture lasts.  I don't have to keep applying it, after I use it, i can go for hours on the driest day before I even think about it again.  I had a sunburn the last weekend, and it was great.  It really helped and I haven't had any signs of peeling.

2.0,A2EWF2OWK60DJW,B004RZHDWM,"I bought this along with 3 other brands of red pepper flakes to make Hong You aka Sichuan Red Chili Oil or whatever you like to call it - the recipe calls for red flakes of chilis, mainly the outside of the chilis not the seeds, and produces the great red oil.  Granted, I don't know exactly what the right name for that specific type of chili flake is 'supposed to be' named, but I just went by the photo in the listing for this product - which looks for all the world like bright red chili flakes with no seeds.

Instead, what I got was mostly seeds, much like the type of seedy pepper flakes you see in a shaker at your local pizza joint - nothing like the photo.  I have uploaded two photos of the product I received, along side the photo that as of this writing is the phone used in the listing for this product (the one with the wide red colored band along the package top), I think it's pretty clear the products are not the same, even if all the words on the packaging are the same.  Anyway, so I put these chili flakes through the steps of creating the Hong You, pouring sizzling hot oil into a bowl on these flakes, and they did not produce any red color at all, so I went further and roasted them toasty in the pan - the flavor was OK, but it wasn't Hong You.

In the past I used a real pumice stone on it as well as a metal file (Dr. Scholl's Callus Reducer) but was not fully satisfied with the results. The podiatrist recommended this Pumice Sponge Block. His office sold it for $4 (so a little cheaper than Amazon if you include the cost of shipping). The sponge did not look impressive. I was somewhat skeptical figuring they are just trying to find another source of revenue for the office. But since it was inexpensive I figured I would give it a try.

The doctors instruction were to leather the sponge up with soap and use it every time I take a shower. After using the Pumice Sponge he told me to use Amerigel Lotion Amerx -Amerx - Amerigel Care Lotion. It has been three weeks since I began using this sponge/Amerigel and I am pretty impressed with the results. My callus no longer bothers me, and my foot feels smooth and soft.

I am attaching a photo of the sponge without a wrapper and at angle that gives you a better view than the official photo.

5.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B0050PSRKA,"I've been dissatisfied with the appearance of the skin on my upper arms for years now.  I've had some success using a Neutrogena body wash and an Amlactin lotion, but I really thought I could use something with more exfoliating power, so I got some of this.  And I'm really glad that I did.

This product has no dyes or artificial fragrances, so it's much less likely to be irritating to those with sensitive skin.  (I have sensitive skin, although the skin of my upper arms is a bit less sensitive than say, my face.)  The texture is sort of whipped and this makes the product much easier to spread than other salt scrubs I've used.  You can actually feel the salt crystals when you use it (but it's a gentle feeling).  It also washes off easily.

I've been applying this 2-3 times a week before a shower and I'm already seeing a little improvement.  I'm a bit hesitant to exfoliate every day, but my current frequency of application seems to be just right for me.

I do not notice a strong fragrance with this.  There are a couple of natural plant extracts (ingredients list is lower on the Amazon product page) that could be providing a subtle scent.  At any rate, I'm quite happy with this purchase and would definitely buy this again.","excellent, gentle exfoliator","clariSEA Pomegranate De-Bump Salt Buff, 15 oz."

5.0,A2JCJJNY43QQIV,B005AQC9U8,"When everyone was wearing clear or neutral glosses, I wasn't phased. I'm a red lipstick addict from way back, and I just toned down the red and added a little gloss to update it.

Thank God, though, it looks like real, pure reds are making a comeback. I read about Besame's vintage cosmetics line, and as my MAC red was about gone, I figured I'd try one of their reds.

My coloring is a brunette with a very fair complexion. Frankly, except for goth dark reds, I can wear pretty much any shade. I picked Besame Red since it seemed middle of the line in terms of color, and I wanted to get an idea how this cosmetics line worked.

The first thing that surprised me is it comes on a card. This lipstick isn't cheap; you'd think the packaging would be a little nicer. (I get they're trying to do vintage cosmetics, but if you're going to make it look like Coty or Max Factor from the 40s, you probably don't want to charge a hefty price for it.)

The other surprise is that the tube isn't heavy. Everyone raves about the metal container, but like so? It's lightweight. I've had some heavy lipstick containers from luxury lines that bragged about the lipstick containers being jewel-like, and they were.

This container isn't.

So now with my quibbles out of the way, let me say the lipstick itself is NICE. Some said the lipstick is small; it isn't. It seems about the size of most lipsticks with a double bevel to make putting it on easy.

I always use a lipbrush (does away with lipliner and makes lipstick in the case last FOREVER. You'll get tired of the lipstick before it runs out.)

The first surprise is the scent. I don't recall any lipstick except some glosses having a discernable scent. This one does, rather vanilla-y. It's pleasant.

The lipstick texture in the tube is, surprisingly, moist. It goes on easily, but it's not so moisturizing that the color doesn't last.

I put it on and did the old fashioned lip blotting with a piece of toilet paper. With a super slushy lipstick, this will almost take the entire thing off. Not so with Besame. The color is very saturated and stayed on my lips nicely.

The lip blotting didn't get rid of the moisture. My lips still feel nice. The color lightened up a bit (which happens with blotting.) You're supposed to add another layer of lipstick after this, but I usually don't. The color was still very saturated, so there was no need for more.

The staying power is excellent! It lasted all day, and my lips never dried out.

If you love the color (and use a lipbrush), you'll get WAY more out of this true red to the point where you'll get tired of it before it runs out.

I'm definitely going to be investigating more of the Besame line.

N.B. One other trick that works if you want your lipstick to last into next week. Blot the first coat and put on a bit of powder with your finger - baby powder or compact powder does nicely. Blot again, and put on another coat of lipstick. It'll last through dinner and into next Christmas. :)",Pure retro red,Decades of Fragrance: 1920

This one did not work out well at all. Much too yellow. Even putting it on the back of my hand looked bad and you could tell a definite yellow tone. The texture was ok, although the scent was a bit much, especially for a product that goes on your face - you can definitely smell olive oil scent. The finish is dewy/shiny and somewhat tacky or sticky. I don't think we would try any other shades of this foundation because the scent is not very pleasant and the finish was not what we prefer. The coverage was ok though. Not too heavy, but enough to even out skintone and give a nice uniform look.",Yellow,"The Body Shop Extra Virgin Minerals Liquid Foundation, 108 Golden Ivory 0.95 fl Oz."

I love the matte texture and it lasts quite a while without being dry at all, which is surprising for a matte lipstick.  The price on Amazon is outrageously expensive.  Sephora has this item for $24.  The only thing I don't like is that I have to carry a sharpener in my purse.  And having to sharpen it wastes some of the product.  But this is my only complaint.  Sex Machine is a pink with blue undertones and it looks great on those with pink or neutral (like me) undertones.  It is not a bright pink but rather, a soft one.  I have several of these pencils, Bettina (a light nude with a glint of pink), Sex Machine, and Dolce Vita (a soft red).  I wish there were more colors.  The matte texture is not at all drying and it has a creamy feel.  It lasts longer than other lipsticks I have, which is a selling point for me.

5.0,AY49JOXTLDOG2,B00FAT8N46,"""Jeff's Wife"" - This is not true to color, it dries quite a bit darker, as you can see from the pic, but since I only use it for nail art I don't care but some of you might. I bought the pink back in Feb. 2015, still using it just got tired of the color, and this one seems slightly less opaque but maybe it's because that one is pink on pale skin but a second coat fixes the opacity, (only 1 coat in the pic). It may leave a few specks of the shimmer on your skin when you peel it off but they wipe away effortlessly.

If you're new to nail art and want to use this for that, I do suggest you transfer some to an empty polish bottle (cleaned with acetone or brand new doesn't matter) using a syringe with some sort of tip, an eye dropper or even a straw, this will keep the large bottle from drying out. This 4 oz bottle will last you a very long time, I still have about half the bottle I bought in Feb. 2015, and costs a fraction of the price as those other brands marketed specifically for nail art.",Good for Nail Art,"Liquid Latex Fashions Body Paint, Metallic Silver, 4 Ounce"

First, the cons.  As a lip color, this is not great for me.  It's a bit too orange for my taste.  I didn't know how else to put it on, so I just used a finger to get some color off and applied it to my lips.  This actually worked well.  But this is just not very smooth or creamy and would probably need to be used in conjunction with a balm or gloss.

Now, the pros.  It actually doesn't look that bad on my eyelids.  It spreads smoothly and provides just a hint of color (use a primer, though, or you'll get creases).  Again, I just rubbed a finger over the stick and applied to my eyelids with the finger.  Also, this is a decent cheek color for me.  I tend to prefer pinker blushes, but will keep this around for days when I want a warmer color.  I swiped it across my cheekbones and blended with my fingers.  It didn't take much, and it blended with my foundation and powder quite well.

At any rate, this worked well for me, for 2 of the 3 advertised uses.  I'd definitely consider buying it when I run out, and would consider other colors of the same product, as well.","works for my cheeks and eyelids, less so for lips",(3 Pack) e.l.f. Essential All Over Color Stick - Golden Peach

Well, the product, for my skin has been great.  The seller even says it contains a natural sunscreen! The morning moisturizer really does it's job and quickly.  My face looked all plumped up and stayed that way, especially after using her night cream as well, in the evening of course.

Please note all the organic ingredients the product offers.  It has a small smell to it, but that is because it is not filled with chemicals, scents and things that are not healthy for your skin.

So far, I really like,this product and will continue to use it and if I see any changes, positive or negative, I will report and update here.

And the sponge gives a gentle scrubbing sensation. To prolong its life, I first wash my hair (my body gets wet) turn off the water and scrub/soap-up my whole body with the Spongelle. Once done, I simply rinse off with the shower. This helps reduce water waste and prolong Spongelle's useful life-span. About a month and a half after first use, I start adding some of my favorite body wash. And after three months I replace it with a new one.","Cleanest feel, soaps up well and lasts over a month!","Spongelle Wild Flower 14+ Uses Body Wash Buffer, French Lavender, 4.25&quot; x 1.25&quot;"

In 1888, a Mr Drake ate a piece of pound cake he enjoyed. By 1890, he had opened a bakery in Brooklyn that sold pound cakes, and went on to develop other products. In 1023 the Devil Dogs were born. Sometime in 2010, Drakes and Hostess was sold and good-bye devil dogs. Then in 2012 a new company took over, and devil dogs were once again on the menu.

I purchased a box of Devil Dogs recently. The taste has changed, not to my taste, exactly. Am not sure what has changed but certainly cheaper ingredients and lots of chemicals. An old taste memory is gone.

5.0,A1GQAKL9CGQLP1,B00J4FJUQM,"Sometimes you want sweet, sometimes you want salty. Sometimes you want a chip and sometimes popcorn sounds tasty. This Popcorners Kettle Popped Corn Chips combine all four wants into one light chip with great texture. The texture is kind of a bubbly, quilted texture which enhances the chips' appeal.

The kettle flavor is just the right amount of sweetness to me so it's not overpowering, yet you can taste a bit of saltiness, too. And the chips are fairly healthy, as they are lowfat, low sugar and low salt.

Ingredients listed on bag: enriched Yellow Corn {Yellow Corn, Niacin, Iron, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid}, Sunflower Oil, Sugar, Sea Salt. The oil used is a healthy oil and like the use of sea salt instead of regular salt.

These are air popped with real corn. One bag has 140 calories and is low sodium (110 mg or 5% DV) and low sugar (3g), so they are relatively guilt-free. There are no artificial additives or preservatives and they are gluten free. This kettle is one of my favorite flavors and the only sweet flavor they make. I like the sea salt, too which tastes like salted popcorn.

Great to serve at a party for something a little different.",Sweet-Salty Popcorn in a Chip,Popcorners All Natural Popped Corn Chips Gluten Free Kettle -- 5 oz (One bag)

I can actually see my pores have shrunk and my skin looks taunter, especially the area around my forehead, nose and cheeks.

I will mention that applying the gel will probably seem a bit unusual.  The jar itself  is very pretty and once I opened it and touched the gel I thought I placed my fingers into mucus.  LOL

You must first wet your face and then apply a good amount to the face using circular motions. As you massage it into the face it will begin to lump together.  The only way to describe this is like taking rubber cement and rubbing it between your fingers until it forms a ball.  It is not a mask that you later peel off, it is used more like a scrub that peels away your old skin cells leaving your face feeling fresh and rejuvenated.  Even though I keep thinking I am using too much, I was shocked that after a week not even 1/4 of the jar is gone.  So the consistency is quite thick and goes a long ways.

You will definitely see results after a few days.  My skin felt silky soft and firmer.  If only I could use it on other areas of my body that could use some firming up.

This Anti Wrinkle and Anti Ageing Beeswax Cream was not an exception.  It is not really a cream but rather an ointment but this was not a surprise for me.  It has a firm consistency and softens from the warmth of the skin.  It is a bit oily but gets absorbed quickly.  It smells so good!  This one contains sandalwood and geranium essential oils, and, of course, there is a wonderful beeswax scent.  I am currently suffering from eye eczema as a result of sun exposure.  My eyes feel raw after washing my face, and even my trusted high end creams are extremely irritating to my eyes.  Fysio creams are the most soothing ones out of all products that I tried, including those that are specifically targeted to eczema sufferers.  I just received this cream today, so I cannot really assess its anti aging effect, however, based on how it smoothes wrinkles and fine lines and firms the skin, I am pretty confident in its long term outcome.  I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but again, I plan on repurchasing it at full price, which I rarely do with the discounted products that I try on Amazon.  Fysio beeswax creams are definitely worth their full price.

This is a powerful moisturizer and feels so luxurious when you apply it. I was so surprised. I have dry skin so my skin just soaked it right up and loved it but for some other people it could be too moisturizing, so that is why you should only use it at night before you go to bed. You will wake up with really moisturized and fresh skin. That is how my skin felt. You do not need to use much at all. Just a little bit because it really is a powerful moisturizer. Any excess I had, I would just apply it to my hands and my hands felt great afterwards.

 I love that this is packed with antioxidants that my skin needs. My skin loved this. My face felt soft and moisturized. There is no fragrance, which is great! Fragrance is actually bad for your face because of the chemicals they use and no one needs fragrance in a face moisturizer anyways. It smells natural, the way the scent should be. I had no reactions or irritations at all. I honestly love this moisturizer. It feels so luxurious just like a high-end brand or what a spa would give you. This is a high quality and wonderful retinol moisturizing cream that does what it is supposed to do. I am so happy to have found this cream. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a retinal cream or have dry skin. It does come with a pink plastic bag for traveling too. I was not too impressed with it, though. I just use it for ribbons and barrettes.  I received this product through a promotion for my honest and unbiased review.

5.0,A3QKWFC92S03MP,B00R3ZJ0V0,"You read right! 11 whopping pounds of dead sea mud from Israel straight to my front door for reviewing and testing purposes from the company called Adovia.

Because there was so much mud in an 11 pound container, I decided to transfer some into little jars and some plastic zip lock bags.

I recently reviewed Dead Sea Mud from a different company and of course it wasn't 11 pounds worth of it but I got to try it for the first time.

That particular mud left a tingling prickly sensation while the mask was drying on my face, so I didn't want to keep it on for too long but I did leave it on for 15 minutes.

The texture in the Adovia mud mask is creamier then the other mud mask I had previously tried on.

I felt no tingling or prickling whatsoever with the Adovia mud mask.
With the other one, after application, I had to put moisturizer on to get some of the redness down. Although it left my skin soft.
But the experience that I just received with this mud mask from the Adovia was beyond my expectations. My face had no redness and it was baby bottom soft if you know what I mean. Lol
All I can say was wow! I did apply my coconut oil afterwards because that is my routine but in reality after the mask I did not need moisturizing. It felt incredible I couldn't stop touching my face.
Next on the list with this mud is my neck and legs and a little goes on a long way and it's so easy to rinse off with warm water.",The Best Mud I ever Tried,"Pure Dead Sea Mud for Skin Care Treatment and Mud Wraps by Adovia - 11 Pounds Resealable Tub - Great for DYI Skin Care, Facial Mud Mask, Scrubs, Soap and Slimming or Detox Body Wrap - Used in Top Spas"

4.0,A331BHAR0TRLWT,B00SG733XK,"I love mascara and try as many brands as I can. I was actually sent a full sized tube of this Wet n Wild Mascara in a subscription beauty box from Walmart or Target or somewhere. I didn't bother to open it for a while because I am used to using Tarte, Lancome, and sometimes Maybelline and CoverGirl. Wet n Wild was never one I even really tried except a time or two.

The other day I saw the package and decided to try it. I have thin straight lashes and like drama. I don't like natural looking lashes, I want LONG, dramatic ones. As this says it is a volumnizing mascara, I expected it to maybe give me some volume and I would use a second mascara for length.

The tube is big and the opening is a bit TOO bit which allows a lot of mascara on the wand. I scrape the brush against the sides as I pull it out to avoid getting too much mascara on the brush and my lashes. To my surprise, rather than giving me volume, I got length and a lot of it. I got a bit of volume but nothing major . But the length! I got not clumps and no spidery looking lashes. The mascara didn't flake or smear and it lasted until I removed it.

Since that day, I have been using Lash Out Loud MaxVolume Plus sometimes with a primer, sometimes with another mascara that gives me more volume but it's fine alone too. I get enough volume so that I don't look freakish with long skinny lashes and I get separation. My lashes wing out on the outside corners, something that ""Cat Eye"" mascara never did for me. I am quite happy with this inexpensive mascara. Shocked but happy. If I got a tad more volume, this would be AHHHHmazing. But as it is, if you like length, no clumps, and spending a few bucks rather than double digits for mascara, this is one to try. I will buy it another tube when I run out of the one I have.",LONG lashes for a LOW price.

5.0,A2D1LPEUCTNT8X,B00W10550C,"&nbsp;This is a hand-made soap.  You can always tell hand-made soaps by their slightly irregular shape.  What I like most about this soap is its scent.  The scent combination is unique and subtle.

I got three different scents Zesty Lemon soap, Grapefruit and Calendula soap, Lavender and Lemongrass soap.  The scents are definitely recognizable, but they are not strong and do not linger on my hands.

My three soap bars are sized 3.5""W x 2""L x 1""H. Each soap weighs 4.2 oz.  The soap is a plain brick but inside of each soap there are specs of mix ins.

I like that it is all natural, no parabens, no artificial dyes, no artificial fragrances.

I received this soaps for evaluation and review as part of a new product introduction. I loved all the soaps, if I had to pick my favorite is Lavendar and Lemongrass, Lavender is a dominant scent but in this soap I can definitely smell lemongrass which makes for a very nice combination.

5.0,AT53ZTTO707MB,B00WHM2OS0,"This water-soluble cleansing oil cleans gently, but very thoroughly.  I wondered about the water-soluble claim, so I tested it by adding water to a small puddle of oil in the palm of my hand.  It immediately dissolves into the water and creates a white liquid.  Washing my face with that white solution left my face and my hands soft, smooth and squeaky clean.

This oil is meant to be applied onto a cotton pad and the pad used to wipe off makeup.  I find that technique works very well for clingy eye makeup.  I don't use heavy foundation, so I don't need an oiled pad to wipe it off.  But after removing my eye makeup, I like to work a bit of oil onto the rest of my face, then apply water as I work it around my face.  It is a very effective way to clean your face.

5.0,AT53ZTTO707MB,B00WQAM0TG,"When I first received this jar of exfoliate and scrub, I used it as a ""stand-alone"" product.  I used very wet hands, just a bit of scrub and not too much pressure.  It's great:  Not too harsh/particles not too large or sharp; fragrance is un-assuming and very pleasant, and my skin feels so soft, with great buoyant texture after I've rinsed and patted dry.

I don't feel the need to use it more than a few times a week--definitely not every day.  When I do use it, I still feel the need to use my usual Deep Clean facial gel cleanser.  Always looking for a way to speed things up and get in and out of the shower quickly, I happened to hit upon a practice that seems to work superbly for me:  Now, when I feel the need for a bit of scrub--when my gentle gel cleanser needs a boost--I wet my face and my hands, dip out a bit of this scrub, then pump my gel cleanser on top of it.  I work it all onto my face together.  Pretty amazing results, and just what I need a few times a week.

5.0,AT53ZTTO707MB,B00WQALW9U,"I'm really enjoying this mud mask.  It is one of the thinner mud masks that I've used, and I like the way it slides on so easily.  I like the feel of the very fine grit on my face.  I am of the opinion that from the moment I apply it, to the moment I remove the last smug of it from my face:  It is working.  Believing what I read about the mineral content of Dead Sea mud and the documented results of the skin tests that have been conducted over the years, I also believe that this mud mask is working beyond the time I remove it from my face.

I can feel the ""zing"" of the action of the minerals on my skin.  I can feel a tingle and a sweet heat on the more delicate areas of my skin..

When I rinsed it off, I worked the mud with its fine, sandy, abrasiveness, into my skin in areas that usually cause me problems:  On my cheek bones, in the hollow underneath my cheek bones, and on the sides of my mouth and in the area between my lower lip and chin.  I am sure it sloughed off some dead skin--I saw it.

When I patted my skin dry, I noticed that my pores were very tight.  That is a good thing.  Then I patted on my witch hazel toner and then my favorite stem cell serum (also from Elrique).

Minerals in the Deep Sea mud are absorbed into the skin while it is on my face, so I leave it on for a good 25 minutes.  (In Coastal Texas, humidity prevents the mud from totally drying and cracking.)  The minerals in the mud stimulate blood circulation.  I've read that documented testing proves that the mud helps with acne and psoriasis.  Magnesium in the mud helps hydrate the skin  and reduces inflammation.  Amazingly, the mud also lessens the depth of wrinkles.

5.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B00WV02MLM,"I've been using this for a few weeks now and I am really liking what it is doing for my hair.  For reference, I have waist-length color-treated hair that I shampoo every day.  It gets a little dry and I live in Georgia so it is humid.  I get a lot of frizz.  This has done a great job at controlling frizz without weighing my hair down.  I do still need to use a detangler and a bit of hair oil afterwards, but as far as a shampoo's contribution goes, I am quite happy with this one.  It gets my hair clean after workouts, too.

Here is the ingredients list since I didn't see it on the product page:

Water, Coco-Glucoside, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Coco-Betaine, Peg-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Polyquaternium-10 Parfum, Grape Seed Oil, Boswellia Carterii Oil, Octyl Methoxycinnamate, Phenoxyethanol, Argania Spinosa Kernel Oil, Keratin, Hydroxypropyl Guar.

This does contain sulfates, so some people may want to avoid using it on color-treated hair.  It has not stripped any color from my hair thus far (mine is naturally light and I dye it black).  Because of the sulfates, it lathers nicely.  It also rinses out cleanly without leaving residue.  And, it is particularly good at getting excessive oils out of my hair (like when I experiment with new hair products and go overboard).  So I am happy.

This does not have artificial dyes, which is nice.  It does have fragrance but it doesn't honestly bother me too much.  I find it pleasant enough and it doesn't stick around for long.  Once you rinse, the fragrance is basically gone.  This hasn't irritated my scalp at all.

Please note that this retails in the 13.5 ounce size new for around twelve bucks (and often goes on sale), so do some comparison shopping before you commit to a purchase.  In the end, though, I am at least as happy with this as I am with some much pricier shampoos so I'm glad I gave it a try!","helps with frizz, gets my hair clean, gentle enough for everyday use",Nth Degree Smoothing Argan Oil and Keratin Collection Shampoo 13.5 oz. &hellip;

I shake this up and then spray on bedding, furniture, etc. -- whatever I want to smell a little better.  These work for all of those applications.

The spray doesn't travel terribly far from the bottle, just a couple of inches.  But it's about what you'd expect from a bottle this size (they're pretty small, around an ounce).  Because of their size, they won't work well for cleaning.  But for cosmetics and similar applications, they're quite good.

Please note: all three of mine were clear with pink sprayers, although the photo shows three different colors.  I don't particularly care, but I figured I would pass that information along.

5.0,A2JCJJNY43QQIV,B00XMZZAMI,"The one thing Korean and Japanese skincare and makeup products do that American companies don't is include these little spatulas in with their creams, lotions, and potions. It's a freaking great idea. You aren't gooping up your manicure by sticking your finger in the jar, and more importantly, you aren't contaminating the products even if you just washed your hands.

I bought a pack of 25, which will serve for eternity since they are thick, sturdy and perfect for endless reuses (you can throw them in a small mesh bag and run them through the dishwasher if sterilization is important to you.)

Another thing they work great on is samples. If you get a lot of samples (I do) and some come in a jar, the samples will last a lot longer since you'll bet getting a precise amount out of the container for your needs. No waste, and no mess! Oh, and I received the spatulas from China in less than two weeks, so it was definitely worth the wait for the price.

5.0,A331BHAR0TRLWT,B00XZCWPDK,"I received this product at a reduced price and was eager to try it and review it. I have always used the blue, thick Aloe Vera gel. It was goopy and sort of like Jello. Last year, I saw it in clear which was nicer than the fake blue stuff but still had a strange thick, jelly-like consistency. My husband sunburns constantly even with super high SPF on so we have Aloe Vera on hand all the time. It's also great for minor burns, cuts, scrapes and all sorts of things. This large bottle has 16 ounces of pure Aloe Vera in it. There are just a few inert preservatives and an ingredient to help the  gel coat the skin better.

The gel isn't really a gel but more like a serum. It is yellowish in color, very pale, and transparent. When I first poured some out (see photo), I couldn't imagine how it could do the job of soothing skin and actually absorbing into skin but but I was wrong. This gel is so much nicer to work with than the thick, jelly type. It immediately absorbs and isn't greasy at all. There's no tacky feeling or, really, any sign that the gel is on the skin at all. But you will feel it soothe. I went to a graduation party the other day and both my husband and I inadvertently got a bit of sunburn, him much more than I. We both used this gel to sooth and cool the areas and it worked so well. My husband, who was a devoted Aloe Vera blue jelly user, loves the consistency of this product and how it just applies and dries with absolutely no wait time and no stickiness or greasiness. It immediately soothes and makes skin feel better.

I even took my make up off with it last nigh! I used some on a cotton round and it did a great job and left my face feeling soothed and clean. There are a ton of uses for Aloe Vera and this brand is even more versatile than the thick, goopy stuff. I truly like it more than any brand I have tried and I really didn't expect to. I thought I would hate it, to be honest, but I am a convert. I am already planning to buy more since we use it year round and like to have it on hand. Give it a try. You will get rid of a lot of the extra chemicals and thickeners and get more Aloe Vera for your money. Plus the formula is perfect for applying and going with no wait time for drying or for the stickiness to pass. Very, very good stuff that is somewhat unconventional as far as consistency but once tried, I can't imagine many people wanting to switch back to the jelly stuff.","So much better than then the thick, jelly-like Aloe Vera gels","Aloe Vera Gel, HUGE 16 Oz.

As the title says, the results are not instant, but by Day 6 they were visible (please see my photos showing the difference).

The eye cream definitely does a good job moisturizing my eyes, and I used it above and below them. As you can see, the eye cream didn't do much for the puffiness above my eyes. This leads me to believe that the eye cream needs the pads to work its magic. I took before and after pictures, shown side by side. But comparing the two, I could see the puffiness is definitely reduced by Day 6. I don't see much difference in the tiny crows feet at the outer corner of my eyes. I probably would have with continued usage if this were more affordable.

I do love the cooling feeling I that I experienced immediately after applying the pads under my eyes each evening. I also discovered, if I replace the film on the eye pads (the film is what keeps the pads from drying out), I can get one more use out of each pad (even experiencing the same cooling sensation the second night).",Results not instant but are visible after Day 6,"VIIcode T2O2.5 Oxygen Eye Cream For Dark Circles and Wrinkles - Reduces Puffiness, Crow's Feet, Fine Lines and Bags"

5.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B011KWHC84,"I am kind of iffy on hair serums a lot of the time.  Many of them are too thick and I end up with oily clumps of hair.  This one is actually different.

I am not totally sure of how this is supposed to be used (I got it in a subscription box, I didn't go seeking it out).  But what I typically do at night is shampoo and condition my hair, then apply a bit of hair oil at the roots and detangler throughout the length.  I let it air dry.  Then I would use a dry oil or similar product the next morning.  I used this in place of the dry oil.  I took two of the tiniest pumps, rubbed them around on my palms, then gently patted/worked this through my hair.  I brushed my hair after that.

And I tell you, my hair looked really nice after using this.  Frizz is down (even at the ends), flyaways are down, but my hair still seems lightweight and flowing (and there are no clumps).  There is also some nice shine.  I did not find this too sticky and even though it looks thick, when I rubbed it between my palms, it warmed up (it contains some natural oils so this is not surprising) and was easy to distribute.  I did not notice much of a scent, maybe a little.  It is clear in color and not watery.

For reference, I have waist-length color-treated hair (I dye it black, so I really like the shine this product provides).  It is Caucasian textured and kind of halfway between wavy and straight.  I can't speak for all hair types, but this works really well with mine.  It is very easy to get just the amount you want out of the container, so little is wasted.  This is also vegan and free of parabens, phthalates, glycols, and artificial fragrances and dyes, if any of those are important to you.",this is awesome for my hair,Tara Smith Base Coat Serum
5.0,A3G3UE0P6T6JRD,B011PIM56W,"I have really long and thick hair.  I love to wear it down, but it gets so hot and I always end up throwing it up in a bun or pony tail.  When I do this I am constantly breaking my pony tail holders.  Most pony tail holders are not for thick hair, they are for normal hair.  I finally found strong pony tail holders that don't break and hold my hair without damaging it.  I completely love this Set of 20 Solid Stretch Knot Ponytail Holders by HBY.

You do get 20 ponytail holders, mine came in a velcro holder which is nice cause it keeps your ponytail holders in place.  They are 2"" in diameter and stretch really well and nicely.  If you have thick hair, these will work so nicely in your hair.  It will hold your hair and you don't have to worry about the elastic ruining your hair.

These ponytail holders do not get tangled in my hair when I take it out either.  Now I know that it might be a little expensive, but these are hands down the best ponytail holders that I have used.  They are made well and the best quality.  I would pay this price over any chepo ponytails that I have to buy over and over.  I completely recommend these a 100 percent!

4.0,A2Y771VL7HT81N,B012ELUFOS,"I do have some stretch marks on my thighs and my breasts (surprisingly none on my belly) mostly from the twin pregnancy and more from the weight gain.  While they usually do not bother me, they do make me self conscious during a swimming season.  The texture of my skin over the stretch mark area is not smooth anymore, so I do not believe a cream would make them completely disappear but I hope that it might make them fade and become less noticeable.  I just got another cream from Royal Sea recently and was so impressed with it, so I ordered this cream as well.

I received Royal Sea promptly and it was packaged in a heavy dark glass jar with a heavy plastic lid tightly wrapped in a bubble wrap.  Unfortunately, despite the protection, the lid was cracked when I received it.  The jar was sealed.  The cream itself is white and has a medium consistency.  I love the scent very much!  It smells like a blend of essential oils with ylang ylang being the most prominent.  The cream was easy to apply and was absorbed quickly and completely without leaving a greasy residue.  There was no stinging or any irritation upon the application.  I have been using this stretch cream for a few days now but I believe it is unreasonable to expect any noticeable changes in such a short period, especially for the old stretch marks.  I think it will take at least weeks and probably a few jars of cream to see any difference.  I am going to continue using it and will update my review if I see any changes in my stretch marks.

Here are the ingredients, since I didn't see them on the product page:

Water, ceteareth-10, dimethicone/silsesquioxane copolymer, grape seed oil, shea butter, argan oil, peg-4 sorbitan stearate, glyceryl stearate, cetrimonium chloride, Boswellia carterii oil, hyaluronic acid, octyl methoxycinnamate, parfum, hydroxypropyl guar, phenoxyethanol, keratin

This has silicones in it, if you are avoiding those.  As it happens, silicone-containing products are quite nice for my hair, especially with controlling frizz, so that doesn't bother me.  This does also have some natural oils like grapeseed, shea butter, and argan oil, and all three of those have generally been quite good in my hair as well.  (I shampoo every day, which can strip oils from the hair, but this helps add some back!)

Please note this is not a vegan product; keratin can only come from animal sources and most of the hyaluronic acid used in industry is a byproduct of poultry processing.

This doesn't have a strong scent, but the scent I can detect is pleasant.  This is so easy to spread throughout my hair and it rinses out cleanly and without leaving residue.  I can actually get by with using much less than my initial instinct because of the texture, which would make this container last longer.  This product is supposed to be for normal to chemically-treated/damaged hair, and I have been dyeing my hair for over 20 years, so it is definitely chemically-treated.  (For reference, I have waist-length, basically straight, color-treated, Caucasian-textured hair.)

Anyway, I use this twice a week.  The next day after use (since I shower at night), my hair is soft and smooth and shiny and manageable, and I have very little frizz and few flyaways.

3.0,A1M04H40ZVGWVG,B0157J4XFG,"I wasn't a huge fan of this - I honestly thought it would be coffee scented (like Lush's ""Cup of Coffee"" body mask/scrub) but rather it has a very off-putting scent to me - just a heads up that this does NOT smell like coffee. More like a chemical mixture gone wrong.
There was also way more oil in this scrub than I expected which left me feeling greasy (not hydrated or moisturized), and I'm not really a fan of that. Add to all that the fact that this made a huge mess in my shower and you can see why I only gave this 3 stars.

So basically when using this you need to accept the fact that you *will* be scrubbing your tub/shower afterwards. It leaves a ton of ""grounds"" or whatever all over the tub, as well as a greasy residue. It melts into a brown sludge which stained my grout.

Coffee body scrubs are quite popular now, and this brand ups the ante with a dash of cardamom. The slight camphor of the spice blends with the coffee in this skin product as nicely as it does in the beverage.
Gentle exfoliation is provided not only by the raw sugar, but also the coffee. Many people use coffee scrubs in conjunction with a weight loss program, claiming that the coffee helps tighten and tone skin. Personally, I think toning has more to do with fitness and diet, but this does make skin feel amazingly soft and smooth. It has even been great on hands and feet as well as other parts of the body.
Just be careful in the tub as it can make surfaces slippery after rinsing it off.

5.0,AJ9ZYMEUY14AX,B015GGRETW,"These are now my go to wraps for skin tightening. This product makes me lose inches by tightening my lose skin, not making me lose fat.

Every time I use these wraps every few days, I lose 2-4 inches in my waist. The results last around 36 hours, and are not permanent. I have loose skin from having a baby, and this product does a good job at making my skin tighten back into place as well as make me look slightly thinner. The gel does not irritate the skin. I do these wraps during the day because I want to drink tons of water and flush out the toxins that it's drawing out of my body through urinating. The wraps fit across my whole midsection and around my love handles, up to my ribs and down to my lady area. It can be cut to use in multiple areas.

In my photo, I am the one in the Bikini top. Instead of the skin being saggy, the skin is tightened to my body as close as possible. This is 12 hours after use.

Curl-ease takes out  the perfect amount of moisture and leaves in what my hair needs.  I have tired the Deva Towel and other microfiber towels as well as tee shirts and my hair is left with halo frizz as the micro fiber takes out too much water and the tee shirt is hit or miss.  With the  Curl-ease it is so simply, after putting in leave in conditioner and my styler on wet wet hair and giving my curls a shake I wrap my hair with the curl ease and leave on for 10 to15 minutes. After I am dressed I take it off, give my curls a shake and viola perfect curls every time with NO halo frizz!  I can choose to diffuse if I want but I always air dry as my hair is just damp.  This towel takes the drips away without removing to much water.  I love it better than tee shirts which work Ok but sometime can give my hair a little frizz and are restricting due to having the hole at the top.  The Curl-ease is the perfect size for long or short hair and certainly better than microfiber.

5.0,A2EWF2OWK60DJW,B017QT9K9O,"I have cool skin tone and need blue-leaning reds - i.e. along the spectrum that includes fuchsia, raspberry, ruby, and cranberry. I also burn easily and need SPF in my lipstick, or my lips will burn right through the lipstick. The challenge has been finding something to wear on my lips at the beach - the typical spf lip balms are clear or nearly clear. So I finally broke down and bought like $100 worth of all the brands I could find of lipsticks with SPF - in colors that I could only hope and guess were cool red/berries based on their names and the phones online.

The only two that were truly a luscious cool-red based color were the Avon brand - the Berry Cute (a very nice pure bright cranberry leaning a little towards fuscia-purple but not too much) and Avon Revenge -- a darker cabernet-raspberry - dark but still ""clear"" and bright, as opposed to having muddy brown aspects.

Every other brand and color were in the red-orange-gold-brown spectrum, regardless of the color names or photos that appeared cool or blue-red.

So after all these years - of trying just about every lip balm and lip stick with spf in the drug stores (and now on Amazon) and finding none that weren't a muddy or orange-y or cantaloupe/salmon hue - I am thrilled to have two lipsticks by the same company no less, that I totally love.  Plus, they go on luscious and smooth and shiny, and feel good and have no taste.  I also tried mixing them on my lips at the same time and got a nice retro-clear-red like the 40's movie stars would wear.  These colors are hard to find in any lipstick, much less one with SPF.

I'm thrilled.",A fabulous high impact luscious cabernet-raspberry vamp color with SPF!!,Avon Beyound Color Lipstick Spf 15 Sunscreen Revenge

5.0,A3OU5DEQVEJC2S,B017WQUXKG,"Vitamin C is one of my favorite skincare products. It really is a wonderful all around ingredient; it helps with brightening skin, lightening age spots, stretch marks, and reducing fine lines and wrinkles.

I like the packaging of this product. It is easy to read the information on the label. I love that it comes in a pump dispenser bottle; very hygienic and easy to use! A small pump was enough serum to cover my whole face and some of my neck, which shows that this bottle will last me a long time. The serum itself has a somewhat unpleasant scent, but not anything that bothers me. The scent wasn't noticeable once I applied the product to my face. The serum went smoothly onto my face. As it was absorbing into my skin, my face felt sticky. As the product absorbed into my skin, I feel like it didn't fully absorb into my skin. It left a slight film on my face. The serum doe help to make my face brighter and look more awake in the morning! I have also been using this serum at night, after my toner and before my moisturizer. I have noticed that with regular use of this serum, my skin is brighter and my fine lines are diminishing, which is amazing!

Vitamin C serums can be used for more than just the face. Vitamin C is great for helping with stretch marks and aging hands as well. My mother has always used vitamin C on her hands, and they look very young for her age! I am excited to try this serum for those purposes too!

This serum also has other ingredients that are beneficial for the skin in terms of anti-aging, acne, and redness. Hyaluronic acid and vitamin E are amazing for the skin and anti aging. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",Love this anti aging serum!,Professional Anti-Wrinkle Vitamin C Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Facial And Decollete Smooth Out Wrinkles With Vitamin C + E Tighten Plump Rejuvenate Brighten Skin 1.7 Fl Oz
5.0,A2XZM64TLWL34O,B017WQUXKG,"This is such a great anti-aging serum that provides moisturizing and tightening effect to my face in the short time since I have followed the instructions and included the serum in my twice a day skincare routine. Hyaluronic Acid helps the skin hold in more moisture; Vitamin C helps brighten and even skin tone. Together, they work magic and indeed are the best ingredients to fight signs of aging. This product leaves the skin feeling silky soft and really helps with diminishing the appearance of fine lines. The serum has worked well with my other facial products and  there is no conflicts in over application of ingredients or mixture of fragrances. My skin does not look quite as tired as before and it has continued to look better.

I love the pump dispenser because it is more sterile than taking it out of a jar or regular container. Aside from the convenience of its portability, after reading all of the benefits, I have been adding it to my daily routine and using it prior to my regular moisturizer. The great thing is that because it is so hydrating that I seem to use less of my regular moisturizer. The texture of this product is a clean feeling and lightweight gel. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and does not leave a greasy feel. The serum has no scent or artificial chemical fragrance which I prefer and a little of the product goes a long way. It takes two small squirts onto my finger to get a thin layer covering my face. Once it dries, it leaves my skin feeling absolutely refreshing. It is quite moisturizing as well, so it locks in all the water in my skin and gives it a supple feel all night long.

The serum takes a minute to dry and then I apply my makeup. My foundation goes on very smoothly over it and it seems like I have been applying much less makeup lately. It helps keep my makeup looking smooth and moist longer. I find it work better as a makeup prime than many premium brand makeup primers I have tried. My facial lines around my nose has even seemed less pronounced under my makeup. In just two weeks I have been using the serum, I have noticed that my skin tone has become more luminous and healthier looking. I have not seen any fading of sun spots that I have, but I am hopeful with long term use that they will eventually lighten up. Based on what my experience has been so far, I am confident that with consistency and patience, I will see more progress down the road. This is a wonderful wrinkle smoothing serum and I highly recommend it.

4.0,A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,B018K6CTZE,"I've owned a lot of cheap salon capes.  They usually come with the hair styling tools.  Most of the time, they are falling apart right out of the package.  This is an inexpensive cape, but it is the nicest cape I have.  In fact, I went and threw out three of my other cheap capes in favor of this one.  It isn't falling apart.  In fact, it looks pretty good.  I was surprised when I put it on my 12-year-old daughter that the back covered her neck all the way down to the seat.  It doesn't look like it would provide such good coverage from the photo on Amazon's listing.

This cape is thin, lightweight, and breathable.  Hair slides off (unlike another one I own that collects it through static cling).  For younger children, the fit might be too loose around the neck, but it's good for older children and adults.  There's a tiny bit of Velcro, which I used instead of the ties.  They could have made that Velcro larger, but it actually did hold the cape closed.  It performs exactly as expected, so I could focus on cutting my daughter's hair and not worry about whether or not her cape is staying on her.

These are very cute, very affordable decals. I like that each sheet is individually wrapped (though I think the instructions on the packets would be pretty incomprehensible for anyone not already familiar with this technique).  For some reason, though, I'm having a harder time applying these than I have had with other brands of water slip decals. I think perhaps these are thinner. The thinness could be a real plus once the decal is actually in place, because it lies very smoothly on the nail. But for now, I'm fumbling with edges that curl back or fold in on themselves, and wasting time and material in the process This could just be my lack of skill.

So I would say that for someone experienced with this technique these could  be a very good buy. I would not recommend them for beginners. I really wish I could love them, but for now a like is as good as I can do.","Cute, affordable, but a little tricky to get on",Born Pretty Flower Owl Nail Art Water Decals Set Transfer Sticker 10 Sheets/Set #20698

4.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B018Z4OKG2,"This mask is complicated to use.  Please note there really aren't adequate English instructions on the package so I will briefly describe what I had to do to get it working.  First you remove the syringe from the narrow pouch on the left.  There is a blue cap on the end as well as a blue plug *inside* the syringe.  There is serum between the end and the plug, and then the plug blocks a small, dry chamber with vitamin powder.  What you have to do is depress the plunger hard enough to displace the plug so that the serum can mix in with the vitamin powder.  This requires a lot more force than you might think.  (Also be sure to hold the cap on the end in place as you don't want to squirt the serum everywhere.)  But it is doable.  Then you shake and shake and shake to mix the vitamin powder with the serum.  Then you uncap the right chamber and empty the syringe into it (this is also kind of difficult and may take a few tries where you detach, remove air from the syringe, and reattach).  Then you recap the right chamber and really massage things around so the serum covers the mask.  Only then do you open the envelope and apply the mask to your face.

On the one hand, I understand why the vitamin powder is separate.  These things can degrade in solution and you really want the freshest, most intact vitamins to put on your face.  So by mixing at the last minute, you will get that freshness.  On the other hand, this took me about twice as long to use as any other mask because of all the mixing and shaking and figuring things out (I typically only leave a mask on for 10 minutes).  Also, I don't feel that I ever really got the vitamin powder completely dissolved (I still saw some stuff floating in the serum) and although I spent quite some time trying to distribute the serum in the mask pouch, the mask was not evenly wetted (although it was about 90% there).

Once I got this set up, though, it was a nice mask.  It fit my face well and stayed in place.  It did drip a lot on my shirt (as badly as the My Beauty Diary masks, if you are familiar with those).  You may want to wear an old shirt or put a towel under your chin or something, to catch the drips.  I used this in the morning before work and it did not interfere with the application of subsequent steps in my skincare routine; I was also able to put on makeup that morning without issues (I have had some skincare products in the past that interfered with makeup application, so it is also important to note when they don't interfere!).

Ingredients include vitamin C (probably the white powder in the syringe, and a great antioxidant), hyaluronic acid (a carbohydrate polymer that holds onto a lot of moisture and will have plumping and moisturizing effects), aloe vera (another great moisturizer), and snail secretion essence (another good moisturizer).  So, this mask is not vegan (in addition to the snail slime, hyaluronic acid generally comes from fish or poultry processing).  But, because of the aloe and vitamin C, this would be great for use after sun exposure.

I found this moisturizing, soothing, and refreshing.  I may not buy it again just because of the hassle to prepare everything, but it was definitely fun to try once.  (Please note: you can get masks elsewhere for under four bucks apiece; I'm not sure how many masks this listing is for.  Just do some comparison shopping before committing to a purchase.)","fun to try once, and a good mask, but preparation was a bit of a hassle",Wellage Vita Blue in Jection DIY Mask Moisturizing Care

***************
The designs are so super cute and finely detailed that I almost want to cry that I'm having such a hard time getting good impressions. If I scrape too hard (or not quickly enough), there isn't much polish to pick up. If I scrape too softly there are smears. I'm pretty new to stamping and don't have a lot of basis for comparison, but it seems as if maybe the etching is shallower on this than the two other plates I have. I should note I have just been using regular polish. So perhaps it's time to invest in real stamping polish and see if that makes a difference.

5.0,A1SCQZYKVCXJ5,B019HM7JLO,"First let me say, I have very dry sensitive acne prone skin in addition to loose skin due to extreme weight loss. This product combined with the Body Toinique Hydration tonic spray has been my holy grail of skin care. It has drawn up my saggy skin like some miracle sent by God & I do not have a double chin or turkey neck as I have lost over 290 pounds. I don't have a single wrinkle on my face at age 40 and my pores are not even visable and my complextion is even and smooth. I have used the Body Tonique product's in combination for 3 years styarting with the classic spray and moving to the rest of the line. This is my single most favorite item. It takes only a pea size amount ater your classic drys and the smell is amazing and has no competition as the classic spray has no scent so it's neutral. This is so light and refreshing not greasy or heavy. I also use it after I shave any part of my body and to treat my hair very curly frizzy hair so it stays tamed which is important when your a fashion and skin care model.  I love that  when I read the ingredients alone it's all organic and natural not to mention all those products seperate would cost me well over the cost of this product and I know because I have tried on my own to make my own skin care and have never been able to but somehow this combination far exceeds the quality I have even paid an embaressing amount of well over $60 for from big department stores with no results, break outs, cloged pores and even skin rash or burns from the excess of essential oils added. Regardless of the season this is my moisturizer after I use my Body Tonique Classic. I am Italian with fair skin and HAD dry, itchy, red sensitive skin with acne. But the best part is if you produce not enough oil or your skin is too oily this  balance's it perfect. My husband is African american and 67 and his is oily. It works wonders for both of us we share the same skin care. Including the amazing lemongrass scented shampoo, conditioner and  body wash that wakes me up in the morning or gives me a calm spa like aroma at night. I have to mention I also no longer have any dark circles under my eyes or on my eye lids and I did before I hated it, I looked like I had a sun burn ring around my eyes but after using the eye cream within just a few weeks it literally faded all together. At this point seeing for me is believing so Im a Body Tonique girl to the MAX now. But what is even more amazing is I mentioned I'm a skin care model and I was not before I started using this skin care line, in fact if you would have told me I would be one I would have lughed at you. But it's true I am now a skin care model for many companies but I never even use their products I use Body Tonique to keep my skin and hair healthy and amazing. Just so you see the results I included my photos of the day before I started using the Classic spray and I posted it on my facebook page for all to see and my now photo and you will see I wear zero makeup and take natural no photo shop or touch up modeling photos.

Although this is my first encounter with this brand, I must say this is a great face cream under makeup and I am glad that I found exactly what I have been looking for. The first thing I like about this product is that it is fast absorbing without any annoying residues. My makeup goes on smoothly and evenly. I also like and respect at all ingredients and directions easily accessible on the side of the container. I really enjoy the tube design container which I can easily squeeze the exact amount of the cream I want and I find it extremely convenient and portable which can be slipped into my purse wherever I go.

It feels smooth and luxurious when I spread it over my face and neck. I have not experienced any irritation or negative reaction to this cream. Nevertheless, it is gentle enough to apply even under my eyes without any burning or itching sensation which has happened with a lot of beauty products I tried over the years. It also has no scent that I can detect which makes this moisturizer perfect for my skin type and my skin soaks right into this product rather quickly. I instantly love the way it makes my face feel soft and supple on first use and the results over the past week alone have continued to smooth my skin significantly. It sits well under my sunscreen or foundation. My makeup does not shift or move after I put it on.

This moisturizer is pretty amazing that it provides moisture without causing any breakouts. This is by far the best daytime moisturizer that I have ever used not only it provides the basic UV protection and a nice matte finish under my foundation, and it also enhances my makeup giving me a flawless and radiant appearance. This product is such a great find that I will always keep one in my purse or carry-on bag. Highly recommend!

5.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B019XF1EES,"I don't even remember where I got this.  But I like it a lot.  (I have shade PP02.)

It goes on very smoothly and is moisturizing.  It doesn't dry out the lips at all; they stay hydrated for hours.  I do get some color wearing off on drink containers, but that is not so unusual for a lipstick product.

This is a BRIGHT fuchsia color, so PP02 may not be for you unless you are into bold colors.  I love bold lipsticks so this is perfect for me.  (I have pale skin and black hair so I like the contrast and pop of color this provides.)  The finish is not shiny/glossy but not *exactly* matte either.

I have not gotten any feathering.  If that is something you are worried about, you can always use a clear lip liner (I like the one from Lipstick Queen but there are some less expensive options available as well).  This wears well; I am not seeing every flaw in my lips.  Instead, I think my lips look pretty good and because this is moisturizing, I don't have to worry about what the condition of my lips will be at the end of the day.  I do have to reapply periodically but this is pretty common for lipsticks.

For a person with a warm, medium-to-dark skin tone this would probably work beautifully and the price for the varied colors you get is a winner. For a pale, cool-toned complexion... sigh. Well, time to keep looking. There are maybe 2 or 3 VERY pale colors at the top left of the palette that are very pale pinkish-toned off-white, but they are too light to be of use in contouring. May be good in highlighting powders for you if you prefer your highlighting powders to be matte.

It gets a 3-star even though it's nearly all unusable for me simply because, for the price (about $18 when I bought it; price may vary here on Amazon from time to time) the number of colors that DO work for me is just great.","If you are a medium-toned, warm complexion, GO FOR THIS!

5.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B01AQYVEC2,"I am participating in a palette panning challenge in an online beauty forum.  This is the palette I picked for this year (I got it back when it was still available at Ulta -- it was an Ulta-exclusive limited edition item at the time and is now sold out there, so if you like it, now is the time to pick it up).

Last year for the same challenge I used Coastal Scents Revealed 2 and I find this Lorac palette is just amazing by comparison.  The darker shadows are much more pigmented than the Coastal Scents palette but it is easy to get just a little on a brush and it is easy to blend these (I have been using the Coastal Scents primer since I have most of a tube of it left; it is sufficient to prevent creasing and migration with these shdaows).

I occasionally get a little fallout but that is usually when I have been too heavy with the brush.  One thing I like here is that if I decide a color is too dark once I put it on, there are a lot of light colors I can brush over it to lighten it up a bit.  It has the effect of increasing the number of shades available to me, and I've gotten some nice layering effects.  The left side of the palette does look like it has a bunch of similar colors, though there are subtle differences if you see it up close (none are pure white and many have soft background colors like pink or tan or yellow).  All of the light shades are good for highlighting around/on the brow bone.  ""Moonlight"" (bottom left) is a great color for brightening the inner corner of the eye.

I'm using the darker colors more than I expected (I'm very pale), probably because they blend so well.  I am even using the dark blue color.  I am not using the top and bottom shadows on the right much (they'd be best as liner colors and I am better at applying pencil liners).  But I have at least tried everything else.  I am liking ""Goji"" (reddish color) and ""Tangerine"" more than I expected, and I am making gold and yellow-tone colors work, which is something I had not previously thought possible.  I like ""Lavender"" and the purple color next to it quite well, also.

Although there are some cool tones available, this palette seems warm to me.  There are no bright pinks and not many greens, and also not as many browns as I might like.  But it is sort of forcing me out of my comfort zone and teaching me to use color combinations I might not have been bold enough before.

The shadow lasts all day for me (over primer) and does not irritate my eyes at all.  This palette does not come with any kind of applicator but I just use eyeshadow brushes and am having no trouble at all.  The pans are smaller than Coastal Scents (Revealed) or Urban Decay (Naked) pans, but there are more colors to choose from as well, so you can create a wider variety of looks.","love this palette, use it every day before work",Mega Pro 2 Palette 32 Colors Authentic

5.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B01B1G0SBM,"I got this in a recent Vegan Cuts snack box and I'm a fan.  I usually just use natural peanut butter (the kind you get straight from the grinding machine at Whole Foods) and this has a very similar calorie count (185 calories for 2 tablespoons, which is about exactly what I want for a sandwich).

This has a very smooth texture.  It's almost a little runny so if you pack a sandwich in your lunch, you might find the inside of the sandwich bag a little messy by lunch time.  But it's not too bad.  The pouch is a convenient package for this product -- it's easy to squeeze out and to really get every last little bit.  I like that you can just screw the cap back on and leave this on the counter or in the pantry -- it does not need to be refrigerated.

Although this says to knead it before dispensing, I have forgotten to do that several times now and it has been fine; I didn't really notice any separation or oiliness.

Flavor-wise, I like this.  It is a bit sweet but not overly so.  It still tastes primarily like a nut butter despite the addition of the seeds.  The seeds are well incorporated (none of that gloppiness you often see with chia seeds) and the texture is smooth and non-chunky.  There is a little hint of fruit to it (I guess from the goji berries?).  I don't use jelly with this, but I don't use jelly with peanut butter either.  You could if you wanted to and it would not conflict.

This is full of protein and healthful plant fats.  Here are the ingredients since I didn't see them on the product page:

Organic Almonds, Organic Sunflower Seeds, Organic Ground Chia Seeds, Organic Coconut Sugar, Organic Hemp Seeds, Organic Goji Berry Powder, Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Lucuma.

This has 3 grams of sugar but the seeds add some fiber, putting that also at 3 g.  Sodium is very low (less than one percent).

4.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B01B27JD3Y,"I've been trying different highlighters and illuminating powders lately.  (I got this as a sample from Choix.)  I don't think this is my favorite (that goes to the Urban Decay Afterglow highlighter) but it is one of my top 2 or 3 along with the Guerlain Meteorite Pearls.

I am super pale, like the lightest foundation shade, so I gravitate towards pink highlighters.  (Neutral ones are often the same as -- or even darker than -- my skin tone.  But pink seems to work.)  I put this on over liquid foundation (right now a NARS one but I am changing those up until I find my perfect fit, as well) and finishing powder.  It blended very well and didn't streak and there wasn't any fallout.  At first, I didn't think it showed up.  But then I stepped back from the mirror and saw a very subtle effect.  I like it, it kind of brightens up my face (I used it on top of my cheekbones) but doesn't make it obvious that I'm wearing a lot of makeup.  So it's good for a more natural look, and it's hard to mess up the application.

This was non-irritating and lasted all day.  I did have to put on a fair amount to get the effect I wanted, but I also rarely finish powders in compacts so I suspect it will last a long time, regardless.

If you are interested in getting this product, I recommend shopping around.  This retails elsewhere for under sixty dollars.  I am definitely considering a full size purchase but I am torn -- using a brush on it would destroy the absolutely beautiful look of the product in the package.

At any rate, I'm happy with the performance and would recommend this as a highlighter especially for people with pale skin.","subtle, natural effect; good for people with pale skin",Givenchy Poudre Lumi&egrave;re Originelle - Soft Powder Radiance Enhancer

5.0,A11WQTPV352LGH,B01B7ADZEO,"Wow!  That's the first word that came out of my mouth when I used this Organic Coco+Nut Oil by Skinfood New Zealand for the first time.  To say I am now obsessed with it might be an understatement.
This Organic Coco+Nut Oil is made with a light weight blend of cold pressed Coconut Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Macadamia Nut Oil, Apricot Kernel Oil and Vitamin E.  It delivers instant hydration and is fast absorbing so there is no oily or greasy residue.
Not only is your skin instantly hydrated but it also feels soft and smooth and as added bonus it gives skin a beautiful, healthy glow!  It's pretty fabulous.
The ingredients in this Organic Coco+Nut Oil by Skinfood New Zealand work together to help heal, soothe, repair, nourish, regulate moisture levels and stabilize the natural pH levels in the skin. It really does a little bit of everything and makes skin look and feel amazing!
This oil can also be used anywhere including nails and hair but this one that I would save for your face, neck and decollete.  My favorite way to use this is as a Sleeping Oil.  I apply a generous amount to my face, neck and decollete before bed and in the morning my skin looks revitalized.  Any skin blemishes or irritations are visibly reduced or completely gone.  Dry patches disappear, skin feels hydrated and it even a looks bit younger looking.  LOVE!
Be grateful that the good peeps over at Skinfood New Zealand are sharing their loving products with us on Amazon so there is no need to travel to New Zealand (not that I wouldn't mind!) to get your hands on their fabulous products.  I can't wait to try more!

5.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B01BBUZZ4S,"I got this in an Ulta gift with purchase and I finally got around to trying it out.  I think this may be my favorite liquid lipstick of all time -- and I have tried them from across the cost spectrum (e.g., Julep, Kat Von D, NYX, Tarte, and Stila).

The color is lovely, somewhere a touch lighter than most berries but less bright or vivid than, say, a fuchsia.  (It looks just a little darker on me than what the product image shows.)

The applicator is a standard doefoot applicator (maybe a bit on the large side, but very easy to use).  It picks up enough product at one dip in the tube to cover the top and bottom lips.  This goes on very nicely.  It is instantly matte, and dark enough that if you want to use a lip liner, you can.  I don't have feathering yet, but the texture is such that this could happen on some people.  It has a slight fragrance that I find to be pleasant and that doesn't linger.

But the main thing in favor of this stuff is that it is moisturizing.  A lot of matte lipsticks dry out the lips, and liquid lipsticks are especially bad about this.  But not this product!

Anyway, I'm a fan.  It is so hard to get a matte look without it being drying.  I am going to get these in a whole bunch of colors, I think.",favorite liquid lipstick,Maybelline Color Sensational Vivid Matte Liquid (40 Berry Boost)

The only priming I did was to use some sticky tape as if I were cleaning it. And I don't think that would have been necessary. It is soft, but not super squishy.  I like that it is clear. Pretty much any color polish will show up, and I can look through it for image placement. I like the protective cover that comes with it. I like the sturdy credit card style scraper.
The only drawback is the small size. I couldn't pick up as much image width as I would like without rolling or pressing really hard, and for some images this led to distortion. So that is why I only gave four stars.

5.0,A2Y771VL7HT81N,B01CJEST9S,"I am recovering from eye eczema as a result of the prolonged sun exposure.  The skin under my eyes is extremely sensitive and get irritated quite easily.  I had undereye puffiness right after the sun exposure, but 2 months later, there is no puffiness but there are dark reddish circles under my eyes that look like bruises.  They prompted questions from people implying domestic violence.  Needless to say, I am quite obsessed with eye care products right now.  I tried many by now and ZesGood eye cream was one of them.

It arrived promptly after placing an order and was packaged in a attractive purple bottle with two pumps, one for a day eye cream, the other one for a night eye cream.  This is 2-in-1 eye cream.  It took several presses on the pumps before the cream appeared which is always the case with new products in the pump form.  The day cream is something between a gel and a cream, and the night cream is a true cream.  Both are easy to apply and stay where you put them.  They have thick consistency, white color, and a very light scent, barely noticeable.  I was not able to recognize rose in it, but I do not buy eye creams for the scent, although I have to admit that rose oil was what attracted me to this cream in the first place.  The cream got absorbed quickly and completely without leaving any greasy or sticky residue.  Both day and night versions are incredibly emollient and moisturized my undereye areas wonderfully.  Despite my eyes being extremely sensitive, the creams did not irritate them at all.  It felt really good on my undereye skin.  I did not use them long enough to report whether it is effective against dark circles but based on their hydrating properties I believe they will make a difference.  Each cream is 15 g, which is common for eye care products.  The outside box has both Chinese hieroglyphs and poorly translated English.  The ingredient list is in Chinese, but there are English abbreviations for DMDMZ(?) and EDTA, as well as a Latin name for Shea butter.  Overall, I was very pleased with these creams, and have a good feeling about their long term use.  I was very happy that they are gentle enough to be used on my eyes with eczema.

3.0,A2Y771VL7HT81N,B01DAKDW42,"I developed an eczema on my eye lids as a result of sun exposure.  My usual eye creams do not work for me anymore as they irritate my extremely sensitive skin and cause new flare-ups.  While I found a few eye products that do not sting or cause more irritation, I am constantly searching for more and kind of obsessed right now to get more relief from itching and redness.  So among other eye products I ordered Body Tonique Repair and Replenish Facial and Body Oil.  It arrived promptly in a sealed 4 ounce plastic bottle.  The twist on and off lid is convenient for precise dispensing.  The oil is a mixture of several carrier oils with mostly oils that are found in the kitchen.  It also has a blend of essential oils that is kept a secret by manufacturer.  I was able to recognize lemon and lavender oils in it.  I applied this oil under my eyes only where I have eczema.  It was absorbed some but left a very noticeable greasy residue.  It felt okay on the lower lids but the oil got on my eye lashes and into my eyes and caused some eye irritation and blurred vision.  It made me blink constantly.  I should put less oil and even lower next time to prevent this from happening.  I already used jojoba, argan, moringa seed, rose hip and sea buckthorn oils and found them to work better and not leave so much greasy residue on my lids.  It is probably better to use it on the body than on the face, and definitely away from the eyes.  However, the biggest issue I have with the price.  While I was offered a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I think the regular price is extremely high for what it is and I will not repurchase this product in the future.",Overpriced,Body Tonique Repair &amp; Replenish Facial &amp; Body Oil

5.0,A2D1LPEUCTNT8X,B01DKTZC0A,"&nbsp;Cash and Bash do not test their products on animals, so they asked me to be one of the human testers for their shaving products: the serum and the cream. I take being a tester very seriously and only accept products for testing if the seller confirms that they want an honest review after a several weeks of testing, good or bad.  I have a history of leaving critical reviews on regular basis.

I have to confess that I have not been very selective about shaving cream for my under arms.  All the stuff I used in the past have been pretty much the same.  This Cash and Bash serum is really different.  The shaving serum feels like you are applying clear oily moisturizer. It does not foam it does not look like shaving cream.  It goes on clear.  It covers my skin with somewhat oily film and the razor just glided over it removing all the little hairs.  The skin is left very smooth still having some of the oily film that was not removed by the action of the razor. Washing with water removes the oily left overs leaving a very smooth skin. Nice!  I did not use much just a small amount for each under arm.  The scent is very subtle, slightly fruity.

After washing off the remnants of the serum I applied a small drop of cream. It also has a very subtle scent, more vanilla than mint.  It felt non-greasy and when I put on a shirt right after applying it did not stain the shirt.

The serum comes in a small pump bottle.  The bottle is 4.5"" tall (not counting the pump) and holds 4 oz.

SERUM INGREDIENTS:
Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Bran Oil, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol Dipelargonate, Aqua (Water), Sucrose Palmitate, Sucrose Laurate, Sucrose Stearate, Parfum, Tocopherol, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Alcohol, Achillea Millefolium Extract, Alchemilla Vulgaris Extract, Malva Sylvestris (Mallow) Extract, Melissa Officinalis Leaf Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Primula Veris Extract, Veronica Officinalis Extract, Benzyl Benzoate, Coumarin, Linalool, Benzyl Cinnamate

I think of shaving as an unpleasant task that must be done and I do it as infrequently I can get away with.  The Cash & Bash serum/cream combo made it much better. No razor burn.

My daughter has really gotten into wearing different hair bows in her hair when she goes to school.  Sometimes my husband does her hair in the morning when i'm not there and lets face it, he isn't the best when it comes to that.  These hair bows are so cute and you get so different colors that have white polka dots on them.  They are easy to put in the hair, so easy that my husband has no issues with these.

You get 8 bows and each one is a different color with white polka dots.  They are a ribbon material and the colors are very vibrant and pretty.  They have the alligator clips on the bows, so you don't have to mess with clasps or anything(those other clasps are hard for my husband to deal with, he loves the alligator clips).

You can put the hair up in a ponytail, braid or up-do and just clip this in.  They don't fall out of the hair, and my daughter being a 6 year old that loves to play comes home with these still clipped in her hair.  I completely recommend it and think they are really cute in my daughter's hair.

I got a heart, several flower shapes, bow and bow tie.  They are all a copper in color with sparkles and a design on them.  One was covered in a red fabric changing the appearance drastically it was very elegant looking.

All the clips were in perfect working order.  They were no marks on them and all the bling was in place. This is a really nice set of hair barrettes.

Every little girl loves to have their hair look pretty and most of them love to wear hair bows.  My daughter has really gotten into wearing different hair bows in her hair when she goes to school.  Sometimes my husband does her hair in the morning when i'm not there and lets face it, he isn't the best when it comes to that.  These flower hair clips are so cute and you get so many different colors and they are easy to put in the hair, so easy that my husband has no issues with these.

You get 10 flower hair clips and each one is a different color.  The colors are very vibrant and pretty.  They have the alligator clips on the bows, so you don't have to mess with clasps or anything(those other clasps are hard for my husband to deal with, she loves the alligator clips).

You can put the hair up in a ponytail, braid or up-do and just clip this in.  They don't fall out of the hair, and my daughter being a 6 year old that loves to play comes home with these still clipped in her hair.  I completely recommend it and think they are really cute in my daughter's hair.

4.0,A2Y771VL7HT81N,B01EMXVZR2,"I am suffering from an eye eczema as a result of prolonged sun exposure. My eyes are itchy and have dark reddish circles underneath, which prompt questions from those who have not seen me for awhile, what happened to my eyes. There have been some assumptions that I have been beaten and do not want to admit that. Needless to say, I am quite eager to lose the look that I am sporting right now, and am obsessed with eye serums and eye creams that can help me with that. So, among others I tried SoonPure Concentrated Hyaluronic Acid Eye Serum.

It arrived promptly and was properly sealed. The box features abundant hieroglyphs writings which I hoped were in Korean, as I highly respect Korean beauty products, but most likely they are in Chinese. I tried to find that out by visiting the website that is listed on the box, however, I found it to be nonexistent. Some lines are poorly translated to English: ""Supplementary eye water and nutrients "", ""Improve the black eye to improve the eye fine lines"", ""Improve eye week"". There is no translation of the ingredient list, however, PEG-40 is in English, and it is my understanding that it is not a desired ingredient for the skin care products. There are some Latin names: Avena sativa, Tremella foci forms, and Butyrospermum parkii, the latter I believe is Shea butter.

The serum comes in a clear 10 ml bottle. An eye dropper was enclosed in the package and needs to be inserted in the bottle. The liquid itself is clear and colorless. It is very runny, but slightly more viscous than water. I was happy that it did not irritate the skin under my eyes which is extremely sensitive right now. I feel that a separate moisturizer is needed to be applied on top to keep the eye area from drying. The serum did not leave a sticky or greasy residue which is a plus. I just started using it a few days ago, so I cannot report any reduction in eye circles. I will update later, if with continued use I see a noticeable difference. I do not currently have any puffiness under my eyes. The serum did not clogged the pores or caused any breakouts. With addition of moisturizer it will probably help with the reduction of fine lines, or at least prevent the formation of the new ones.

They are very long but I just stuck them on my nails and then filed off the excess.

The 10-pack is useful to me because I'm breakout prone, and can't afford to take the risk of wearing the same headband again.  This gives me enough headbands so that I use a fresh headband every day and still make it to ""laundry day.""

These headbands are better than the other HBY headbands I tried that were made out of shiny spandex.  (Which were slippery, poorly stitched, and definitely not moisture-wicking at all.)  These appear to be some type of cotton blend jersey, which is very comfortable and grips my smooth hair better, and there are no problems with the seams.  The product description says 5 inches, but they're really more like 4.75 inches, but that works in my favor, since the wider ones slide off my head too easily.

Also, unlike the other headbands I tried, this time I got exactly the colors that were pictured in the product photos.  These headbands are much better performers overall than the spandex ones, and I'm happy with the quality.  I still can't use these for running or sleeping, since they slide off my smooth hair at the drop of a hat, but they are very useful for face-washing and general lounging.

It is a very hydrating and nourishing cream that leaves skin soft and supple and moisturized all day long.  As with a lot of the other Living Nature products this one has all natural Active Manuka Honey Totara Extract which help promote moisture, nourishment and fight off skin-ageing free radicals!
However, if you have oily or combination skin this might not work as a day cream but I would highly recommend it for dry skin.

Here's what I'd want to know:

Does it clean well?  Yes.  I have oily skin, and this took the remains of the days off without leaving my skin tight.

Does it smell good?  Not really, but it doesn't smell bad either.  It's clean---but it doesn't appeal to me personally.

Is it a pleasure to use?  Yes.  It's a cream texture--and pea sized blob produces a lot of lather.  It seems to rinse well.  I don't look forward to using it because I don't love the smell, but it takes makeup off quickly.

Does it outperform drugstore level cleansers?  No.  I've used many face washes like this in the past.  It reminds me of the Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Cream Cleanser ($7.99 for 5oz) which I didn't love.  This cleanser is pleasant enough.....but it's not anything I would rush out to buy again.

4.0,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B01H4LWGIG,"I try to use a sheet mask at least 5 times a week.  I subscribe to a couple of sheet mask subscription boxes and I received this mask in one of them and tried it out yesterday.

As a mask, it was pleasant.  It was easy to unfold without ripping, it fit my face fairly well, it didn't drip on my shirt too much, and it stayed in place once positioned.  It was a little high on the serum so it took a minute after removing for it all to soak in, but it wasn't too much of an inconvenience (at least, not much more than any other mask I've tried lately).  Afterwards, I continued my morning skincare routine and then applied makeup and this did not interfere with any subsequent products I used.

This has a light fragrance that is slightly fruity.  It honestly doesn't persist for long after you apply the mask.  It does not have any artificial dyes and it did not irritate my skin or eyes while I was wearing it.

I cannot find a complete ingredients list in English but of course I have found a few highlights.  This has extracts of blueberry, grape, chia seeds, mung bean, and soybean.  These are fermented to form something called a ""blue energy complex.""  I am skeptical of whether fermentation would actually do much to alter the ingredients in an effective way (search for ""Fermented Skin Care, the Latest Korean Beauty Trend, Might Not Do Anything"" and read the Racked article for a more complete explanation, which makes sense to me as a biochemistry PhD).

That being said, I do like the ingredients.  Blueberry and grape are excellent sources of antioxidants and vitamins so this could be good to use after a long day of sun exposure (of course you should also be using a good SPF product).  Chia seeds have lots of proteins and fatty acids and I have always found fatty acid-containing products to be quite moisturizing.  Mung bean extract is supposed to help tone and reduce pore size.  I can't say whether I actually noticed a change or not, there.  Soy extract is supposed to be soothing and I do think this mask is soothing (Paula's Choice rates soy extract as ""best"" in their ingredients database).

Anyway, I found the mask moisturizing and smoothing and I do think I saw a little redness reduction.  Plus, even if I can't see antioxidants and vitamins working on a microscopic level, I like knowing that they're in my skincare.

For reference, this listing is for ten masks listed at around twenty bucks total, so it is competitive at this time.",moisturizing and soothing and has lots of antioxidants,[SNP] Aqua Energy Fermentation Mask (10EA)
